		["With the camera, of course! Good Goddess,\nI don't advocate violence!\nAs a gentle introduction to my photographic challenges, I'd like you to snap a shot of a monster out in the wild. Any one will do!", true],
		["The monsters known as jailcats are said to be very pernickety pusses when it comes to hygiene. Just occasionally, you can actually spot them washing their faces. That's what I want a snap of!", true],
		["I hear there's a monster called a khalamari kid that likes to draw little doodles on the ground. It's clearly rather a juvenile thing to behave like that. Apparently you see them stretching sometimes, too, and generally doing whatever they want to do. Could you snap me a shot if you see one doodling?", true],
		["I don't know what they're called, but there's a type of monster that's twins, apparently. They look almost identical, but one's always red and one's always yellow, I hear. And they're totally inseparable.\nWould you snap me a shot if you happen to see one?", true],
		["There's a monster that looks rather like a luscious pair of lips, would you believe? A kisser, it's called. It breathes Sweet Breath and puts travellers to sleep before attempting to plant a peck on its unsuspecting victims.\nYes, it's a terrifying creature, but might you be brave enough to snap me a shot of one?", true],
		["I've heard people talking about a monster\nthat's a knight atop a green-coloured slime.\nIf you come across one, would you be so\nkind as to snap me a decent picture of this extraordinary<->sounding creature?", true],
		["They say the monsters called tap devils are exceptional dancers. Apparently, they just start boogieing away whenever the mood takes them! Quite unbelievable, isn't it?\nWell, perhaps you could take me a photograph of one dancing so I can see for myself if it's really true or not! ", true],
		["Somewhere in this wonderful world of ours is\na monster made entirely of gold called a gold golem, apparently. Now there's a walking fortune if I ever I heard of one!\nI should very much like to see a photograph\nof that if you could oblige?", true],
		["I've heard mention of a monster, ominously called a killing machine, that has red eyes and a blue body. It's uncommonly violent, but its sleek appearance has gained it a dedicated fan base.\nIt would be madness to go anywhere near such\na thing, but if you happened to, well, go mad, perhaps you could snap me a shot of one?", true],
		["I'm afraid I don't know the thing's name, but I hear there's a kind of monster that's sort of purple and blue, with a grim-looking face on its back. It's usually docile as far as I can tell, but can turn very menacing indeed if provoked.\nI must say, I would love to see a photograph of this exceptional beast. Could you take one?", true],
		["I've heard mention of a rather enigmatic<->sounding monster called a dark star.\nHow can a star be dark, I ask you?\nI'm really most curious about it.\nIf you spot one, could you snap me a shot,\ndo you think?", true],
		["Apparently there are giant blue lizard-like dragons somewhere in the world that are supposed to bring you good fortune. Not my experience, however! I very nearly came to a sticky end once when I encountered one myself!\nAnyway, if you happen to see one of these dubiously lucky dragons, would you mind trying to sneak a photograph of it for me?", true],
		["People claim there are great sabrecats as white as snow out there, you know. I don't suppose I'll ever be able to ride one myself, but if I could at least see a photograph of such a magnificent beast...\nWould you be so good as to snap me a shot of one of these so-called light sabrecats?", true],
		["I've heard talk of so-called sablecats <endash> jet-black sabrecats with purple manes. I don't suppose I'll ever get to ride one myself, but if I could at least see a photograph of such a magnificent beast...\nCould you try to snap me a shot of one of these mysterious creatures?", true],
		["Everyone loves metal slimes, don't they? For all manner of reasons. But the little nuggets are so hard to come by.\nDo you think you could snap me a shot of one of these paragons of preciousness?", true],
		["We'd all like to come across a liquid metal slime, of course. But those little critters are more slippery than a banana skin soaked in oil!\nDo you think you could snap me a shot of one of these silver standards of scarcity?", true],
		["Metal king slimes are the rulers of their class in every way, I say. The fastest to flee, the hardest to hit, the most sought-after to spot!\nDo you think you could snap me a shot of one of these super-sized silvery sovereigns?", true],
		["Ever since the sky turned red recently, I've been hearing a most disturbing rumour. Apparently, a monster has appeared in the sky that's larger than a mountain! I cling to the hope that it is just a tall tale, but I'd like some more concrete reassurance.\nCould you take a photograph of whatever this giant thing is that people are seeing in the sky?", true],
		["People say that somewhere in the world, lying dormant in slumber, is the most mighty and most dastardly of all monsters, who was sealed away in antiquity.\nIf you happen to chance upon such a fearsome creature, don't forget to snap a shot of it for me!", true],
		["Apparently, if you defeat thirty slimes, a large monster appears in the countryside around Farebury.\nIt's a rather rare occurrence, so I wonder if you might snap me a shot of it? But I hear it's considerably tougher than other monsters, so mind you don't get creamed!", true],
		["Apparently, if you defeat thirty mummy boys,\na very colourful monster appears to the north of the bridge in Ascantha.\nIt's a rather rare occurrence, so I wonder if you might snap me a shot of it? But I hear it's a lot tougher than other monsters, so don't get beaten. I don't want to have to take the \u2018wrap\u2019!", true],
