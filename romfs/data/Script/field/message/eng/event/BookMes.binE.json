		["\u2018She took an imp knife, and cut a magical skirt that was lying on the table. Then, with a dash of some mysterious powder, everything was enveloped in smoke.", true],
		["\u2018When the fog finally cleared, I was stunned to see a beautiful dress in place of the skirt on the table. This \u201cwicked\u201d witch was simply making clothes!", true],
		["\u2018Confused, I turned to leave. But as I went, I saw the witch hold aloft her newly made garment in admiration, and I could swear I heard an evil cackle...\u2019", true],

		["\u2018At least if others follow in my footsteps, they may find this note and know the secret recipe. Good luck, my fellow questers, I wish you well!\u2019", true]
