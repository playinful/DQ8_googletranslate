		["<se_low>Kalderasha: So, you return again! I see you are still on your travels. And looking well.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: So, did my fortune-telling help you?", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: Nowadays people say that what I see in the mists is always true. But fortune-telling is a haphazard business. You can never be sure.", true],

		["<se_high>*: My little boy's picked up that \u2018such a pity\u2019 thing. He says it with almost every breath!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wish that jester had taught him something a bit more cheerful!", true],

		["<se_low>*: Really!? You've got your own ship!?\nSo you can just sail around wherever you like?", true],
		["<se_low>*: That's amazing. So I know someone with their own ship! That makes me pretty special, eh!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is just between you and me, but I was planning on making a suit of metal king armour if I managed to get hold of the alchemy pot.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'd even found out the recipe for it, you know. What a waste! Who'd have thought it would elude me for so long!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Master Rylus was a narrow-minded old chap, but he had a good heart.", true],
		["<se_low>*: He had an apprentice, you know.\nA haughty one, but completely useless at magic.\nHe was quite a handful.", true],

		["<se_low>*: Hm? What was his name, you say? Well now,\nI can't remember. It was a rather peculiar name.\nDhoul-something or other, I think.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Valentina told me all about how you helped Kalderasha get back on his feet.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I don't know why you did it, but I want to thank you, too.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Trodain Castle's in ruins, they say! I had no idea. It's come as quite a shock, I can tell you.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I used to work there, you know, in the dim and distant past.", true],
		["<se_low>*: ...As far as I remember, they kept a magical sceptre there. Yes, that's right. It was locked away and never allowed outside the castle.", true],

		["<se_high>*: You know that bridge over the ravine to the west? Do you know when they're going to fix it?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I suppose no one wants to visit that ruined old castle over there, so it doesn't really matter.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If you're looking for that rather wealthy<->looking couple who were staying here before, they've gone home now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It was a funny thing, you know. The wife had lost her ring, but it turned out her husband had actually dropped it down a well by mistake!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You should have seen it when he finally owned up to her! There was one almighty row,\nI can tell you!", true],
		["<se_low>*: He got such a tongue-lashing that he went out and bought her a brand new ring, there and then! That seemed to calm her down a bit!", true],
		["<se_low>*: After that, they didn't need to stay here in Farebury any more, so they went home.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Listen to me!\nGossiping about a couple's private argument!\nThat's pretty naughty, even for me!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I just can't help myself.\nIt's very interesting what goes on, you know.<page>*: But I've got into trouble for gossiping\nmore than a few times now, I can tell you!\nHeh heh heh!", true],

		["<se_low>*: Many years ago now, Valentina's father was wrongly accused of...something or other, and he had to go into hiding.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The people who were after him went to Kalderasha to find out where he had gone.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Back then, Kalderasha was well-known for being bang on the mark every time, so he could see exactly where Valentina's father was.", true],
		["<se_low>*: When the people who were looking for him finally flushed him out, they all got into a bit of a chase.<page>*: Valentina's poor father fell over the edge of a cliff and died.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The news that someone had perished as a result of his fortune-telling made Kalderasha deeply depressed.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: There was a lady here before who kept asking Father to help her find a ring she'd lost.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: But for some reason, Father just refused to do it.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: Then I found out later that it was the husband who'd dropped the ring somewhere.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: I wonder what would have happened if Father had told the wife what her husband had done.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: Of course, Father didn't say anything,\nbut I think he was trying to protect them.\nHe was thinking of what was best for them\nthe whole time.", true],
		["<se_high>Valentina: My father can be a difficult man at times,\nbut he always considers the consequences his fortunes will have on his customers.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I really wanted to make a suit of metal\nking armour when I got the alchemy pot.\nBut now it's lost forever.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What? You want me to tell you the recipe for making it?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, no, no! It might be useless information now, but I went to great pains to get it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm not going to give it away to some <IF_SOLO>traveller<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>travellers<ENDIF_SOLO> I don't even know.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Just after Rylus passed away, there was a spate of strange occurrences. But everything's peaceful and calm now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: For a long time, I feared that the death of one of the heirs of the great sages would herald something terrible.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But it seems I had nothing to worry about. All is well in the world.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I've got it now! I remember absolutely everything!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Valentina's true mother suffered such a shock when her husband met with his sudden and unfortunate end, she couldn't get out of bed.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It wasn't long before she passed away, too.<page>*: Kalderasha held himself personally responsible for everything that had happened and took young Valentina in.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But the realisation that his fortune-telling had caused such misery for an otherwise happy family plunged him into a terrible depression.", true],
		["<se_low>*: What's your problem!? What are you doin' comin' in the back way, eh!? The front door's round the other side!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ha ha! You must be new to this game, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>*: I knew it! How about I give you a few pointers to get you started then?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Listen. Havin' a load of weapons and armour knockin' about in your bag won't do you no good. You've gotta equip yourself with 'em!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You're not? Well I reckon I could still teach you a thing or two.", true],
		["<se_low>*: How about this? When you come across monsters that are weaker than you, you can just intimidate 'em to save yourself a fight.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Most of the time they'll just run away.\nDid you know that?", true],
		["<se_low>*: But if you try pullin' the same trick with stronger monsters, you'll soon know about it! You've gotta weigh up each monster carefully.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If you're looking for that rather wealthy<->looking couple who were staying at the inn before, they've gone home now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It was a funny thing, you know. The wife had lost her ring, but it turned out her husband had actually dropped it down a well by mistake!", true],

		["<se_def>*: Yes, that's right. Liquid metal armour...\ncrown<...>that hard wotsit<...>alchemy pot...\n(Mumble mumble)", true],

		["<se_def>*: Hu hu hu! Don't you worry! I've got a little surprise prepared for you!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I took off west a few days ago and went\nto Trodain Castle. It was quite a journey,\nI can tell you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So go and have a look around the old ruin. You'll find a very interesting recipe by a certain fountain in the grounds!", true],
		["<se_def>*: What? You've already got the recipe?\nWow! I can hardly keep up with you!\nAre you following me or something!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Right then! I'll hide the next recipe somewhere you'll never find it!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah, wotcha! You're back, eh!?\nSo, still travellin', then?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Must be pretty tough bein' on the road for so long.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But I suppose that means you must have a good reason to keep goin'. Well, good luck with whatever it is!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah! So you finally managed to catch up with that jester, eh!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: So how much did you get back then?\nHe didn't look like the sort who'd have much to be honest...", true],
		["<se_low>*: What? What do you mean, what am I talking about? The money he owed you! You lent that jester some cash, didn't you?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Huh? So you're not chasing that clown any more? The one who was always moaning about what a pity everything was.<page>*: Who are you chasing now, then?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Is it like hide-and-seek?\nCool! I wish I could play!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Huh? So you're not chasing that man any more? The one who was always moaning about what a pity everything was.<page>*: Who are you after now, then?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Is it like hide-and-seek?\nCool! I wish I could play!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I heard there's a tradition in Argonia that royal brides-to-be get given a really rare gemstone as an engagement present.<page>*: It's called an Argon heart.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And the current Prince has just found one that's bigger than ever before!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wish someone would give ME a beautiful gemstone! The bride must be the happiest girl alive!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The house that used to stand here burnt down some time ago. The poor old man who lived there perished in the blaze. It was very sad...", true],
		["<se_low>*: I thought it was the least I could do to say a prayer for him.", true],
		["<se_low>*: He was quite a looker, you know.\nAnd the heir of a great sage, apparently.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You know, I've remembered now.\nOn the night of the fire, that rather macabre jester chap was wibbling on to himself about something. Very odd, it was.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Something about some great sages.\nA bloodline, or something. I don't for the life of me know what he was talking about.", true],
		["<se_low>*: And then he let out a really rather sinister laugh, actually. Kept saying something was\n\u2018such a pity\u2019, if I'm not mistaken.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: So! You have rid us of the evil Dhoulmagus\nat last.", true],

		["<se_low>Kalderasha: If you are in need of guidance, come back to see me. If I am not too busy, I will look into the mystic mists of the crystal for you.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: It is unfortunate that your journey could not end when you defeated Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: If I can help you, come to see me. If I am not too busy, I will see what I can see in my crystal ball for you.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: Just remember that fortune-telling is not the solution to every problem.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Really!? You mean he actually changed form? Into a monster!? Wow! I had no idea Dhoulmagus could do that!", true],
		["<se_low>*: ...So, that explains it then! Now I know why his personality changed so much from before.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Somewhere down the line he must have been possessed by that monster.", true],
		["<se_low>*: There's no other way to explain how someone could change so much.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So that jester was a real villain, I hear.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I keep telling my little boy that he mustn't copy what that bad man said, but...", true],
		["<se_high>*: He's still coming out with it all the time.\nIt's such a pit<endash> Oh, bother!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh dear me! I'm afraid customers aren't allowed behind the bar.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Would you mind going round and using the main entrance?", true],

		["<se_def>*: She's turned into a fine young lady.\nIt'll be a very lucky man who takes her as a wife.", true],
		["<se_def>*: We carried out a very thorough investigation, but we never managed to track down the criminal who broke through the southern checkpoint.", true],

		["<se_high>*: Welcome to The Weary Wanderer!\nFarebury's oldest inn!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm here to make your travels more comfortable and explain a few things.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Any seasoned traveller would know it already,\nof course. But if you've only just set out,\nit might be useful. Would you like to hear it?", true],
		["<se_high>*: That's fine. I just thought maybe you hadn't done much travelling before and I wanted to help...", true],
		["<se_high>*: The A button is really useful. It lets you do a whole range of things, like chat to people and pick up or examine objects.", true],
		["<se_high>*: You can examine everything in this room just using that one button.<page>*: The wardrobes, the sacks on the wall,\nthe treasure chest, the bookshelves, everything!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Feel free to take anything you like.\nIt's all there for the customers.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh, and holding down the L and R buttons together briefly lets you look at things through your own eyes. Press the A, B, X or Y button to switch back again.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's really useful when you want to examine things that are very close to you, or if you want to look down at the ground or up into the sky.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And, er...that's about everything I can tell you, I think.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's lots more to learn, but I'm sure you'll work it out for yourself along the way.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Don't forget that really useful button I told you about at the beginning! And enjoy your travels!", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: ...So, you know about the Monster Arena, hm?\nRemember, the Great Kalderasha sees all!\nYou cannot hide things from my eyes.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: Sometimes it may be...advantageous to empty your mind of your quest, and take part in this \u2018sport\u2019.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: Do well in the arena, and you will find people are drawn to your success. One man could be so drawn, he may even wish to join your...wagon quest, perhaps?", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: .........", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: By the way, as I was clearing the mists in my\nsearch for information about Rhapthorne,\nI saw something. Neos, as it is, in ruins.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: I am perhaps mistaken, but I have a strong\nfeeling there is more awaiting you on the\nHoly Isle.", true],
		["<se_low>Kalderasha: But who am I to say, hm?\nI tell you only what I see in my crystal ball.\nPerhaps my fortune-telling is just...haphazard!", true]
