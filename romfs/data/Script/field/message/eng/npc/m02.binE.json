		["<se_low>*: Bad things are happening in the world.\nIt's obvious enough to us all, seeing the sky burn red like that. I'm sure I'm going to die.", true],
		["<se_low>*: At least I'll be able to take the vision of your beautiful body with me to the next world.\nA man can't get much luckier than that.", true],

		["<se_def>*: If only I were a hero with heroic powers.", true],

		["<se_def>*: I've been working for the Albert family for thirty years, you know. And I've got no regrets at all.", true],

		["<se_high>*: I came to see Lady Rosalind to try and cheer her up, but I just don't know what to say.\nWhat can you say at a time like this?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Waaaah! Aaaah!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone's saying the same thing. Something very strange about the sky being on fire.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But I was having a doze at the time,\nso I didn't see a thing.", true],
		["<se_high>*: When I think that I might die soon...\nWell, it's pretty scary.", true],
