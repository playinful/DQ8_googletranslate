		["<se_high>*: Abbot Francisco was like his own father. Marcello must be taking it very hard indeed.", true],

		["<se_def>*: Why would anyone do such awful things?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's dangerous beyond this point. You must leave!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I put the horse and cart in here earlier. No mistake.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe it got away in all the commotion when the fire broke out.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It was in this very room that Abbot Francisco... No, it's too painful to talk about.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Holy Father was a pillar of strength for all of us. He was the very heart of this abbey. Curse that evil jester!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ............", true],

		["<se_def>*: Now that we have a new abbot, special masses will obviously cost many times more than they did before.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Naturally, the new Abbot is an exceptional fellow, but he's very pushy when it comes to donations.<page>*: The abbey will bankrupt me at this rate!", true],
		["<se_def>*: We Templars sleep back there with the monks.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ah, Angelo! Is it really true that you were expelled? Huh huh huh!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Now I can let you in on a little secret I heard. Captain Marcello and Angelo are half-brothers, apparently.", true],
		["<se_def>*: They say one of them was born in wedlock, while the other is the result of a fling the father had before he was married.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Captain, er...Abbot Marcello will be in charge of all abbey affairs from now on.", true],
		["<se_def>*: First we must collect more donations and expand the abbey. Then we can move on to grander schemes.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Why hello, Angelo. Do you REALLY think a person like YOU could avenge the Holy Father's death!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Angelo is a real trouble-maker. All the same, I'll be sad to see him leave.", true],

		["<se_def>*: The good times when Abbot Francisco was in charge are over now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Marcello is very able, but he's far too ambitious for a man of the cloth.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Now that Abbot Francisco's gone, there's no one resolute enough to oppose Marcello.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Since Marcello became Abbot, I don't know... The Templars seem to be rather over-confident. Arrogant, even.", true],
		["<se_def>*: A mere monk such as I is worth nothing around here, it seems.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ouch! It still hurts! That jester was something else. We didn't stand a chance.", true],
		["<se_def>*: We survive, and yet Abbot Francisco dies because of our incompetence! We do not deserve to live!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The rich are unlikely to pass through the gates of heaven.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Abbot Marcello is only trying to help them by demanding such generous donations.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ah-phew... Ah-phew...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Abbot Marcello remains Captain of the Templars. This is his chamber. His private chamber!", true],

		["<se_def>Marcello: Well, you all appear to be in good spirits.", true],
		["<se_def>Marcello: No doubt drifting from place to place at your leisure is most enjoyable. But were you not supposed to be pursuing Dhoulmagus?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Simply having a new abbot in charge has changed the whole atmosphere of the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>*: In a word, there's just so much more to do now. Ever since Abbot Francisco passed away, our workload has doubled!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Dear Goddess, please let Abbot Marcello look upon me with favour, that I may be blessed with a position of merit and worth!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well? How about a trip to The Cock and Bull, then? There's no more Angelo to get in the way, if you know what I mean!", true],
		["<se_def>*: What are you doing here, Angelo? Aren't you supposed to be going after the person who killed Abbot Francisco?<page>*: You can't laze around all your life, you know!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The bunnies in the pub, the skirts in town... All back on the menu, now Angelo's out of the picture!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The abbey's not for you, Angelo. You need to spread your wings. You've got potential. Don't worry about things here. Just go! Far away!", true],

		["<se_def>Marcello: ............", true],
		["<se_def>Marcello: We're too weak to avenge Abbot Francisco's death at the moment. Dhoulmagus is too formidable an opponent.", true],
		["<se_def>Marcello: I'll have Angelo and those travellers ascertain his whereabouts and, if a battle ensues...<page>Marcello: Well! Perhaps I'll be lucky enough to see two \u2018birds\u2019 killed with one stone!", true],

		["<se_high>*: Dear Goddess, I pray to you! Make my child a bit cleverer!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Almighty Goddess! Now may I be welcomed at the gates of heaven when I pass from this world!? I have paid 15,000 gold coins!", true],
