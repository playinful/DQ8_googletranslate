		["<se_def>*: The royal family of Argonia are very approachable, but that doesn't mean they'll just grant every favour they're asked.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But if they were in your debt somehow,\nthen I'm sure they'd try to grant even the most demanding of wishes.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles tried to do a runner to Baccarat again, apparently!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's the first thing he does when he's stressed. He always turns to gambling! Sounds more like a lowlife from Pickham than a prince!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There was a real hullabaloo at the castle before because Prince Charmles had gone missing. Sounds like they've found him now, though.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He was probably hoping to get away while everyone was in such a fluster looking for him.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But the Chancellor was quick off the mark for once, and had the exits sealed so he couldn't escape.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I heard the news about Abbot Francisco at Maella Abbey being assassinated. What kind of person would kill a man of the faith like that?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Wow! So there's a magic mirror in Argonia that dispels darkness!? You certainly know your stuff!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Still, the royal family employ several magicians, so I suppose it stands to reason that there'd be a lot of magical things here.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I haven't been able to get inside the castle up to now because Prince Charmles was causing such a stir.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But I finally got in just now and managed to get hold of my permit for setting up shop during the bazaar.", true],
		["<se_def>*: You can go in and out of the castle whenever you want now. Prince Charmles has been found at last, so the doors are open now.", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is the entrance to Argonia Castle.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The view of the town from the top of the castle is amazing, isn't it?<page>*: And it gets even better when the bazaar's on. You've never seen so much hustle and bustle!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! I'll be in trouble! I was supposed to be making sure Prince Charmles doesn't leave his room!", true],
		["<se_def>*: He may be cowardly, but he can certainly make a quick getaway when he wants to!\nHe's like a liquid metal slime!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's my job to guard his room and make sure he doesn't escape.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Argonia Castle opens its doors to everyone, but please make sure you behave properly when inside the castle walls.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I only just heard this, but apparently there's some kind of agreement between Trodain and Argonia.<page>*: They say if a boy and girl are born in each kingdom, they have to marry!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The agreement was made a long time ago,\nso Prince Charmles and Princess Medea are fulfilling a vow their grandparents made.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I wonder what it's like to be engaged from the minute you're born? Do you think they're happy about it?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm supposed to be a maid, but until the other day all I was doing was looking for Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I thought it was a bit of a waste of time looking for him when he was probably long gone, but he was actually inside the castle all along!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Can you believe that they finally found Prince Charmles hidden in a barrel, of all things!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: He must be braver than we thought to endure so many days stuck in a tiny space like that!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Hm? A magic mirror!?\nNo, I've never heard of anything like that.", true],
		["<se_high>*: If you want to know about magic, you should ask one of the royal magicians. They'll probably know what it is you're talking about.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I can't believe I let that no-good jester escape! I've got a feeling I'm going to regret that blunder for many a day.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well, I won't let him go when I see him next time!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Not that I particularly want to see him again, of course. I was sure my number was up at the time.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Actually, a very strange jester was here at the castle the other day. He sort of appeared out of nowhere.", true],
		["<se_def>*: No one really paid him that much attention, what with all the fuss Prince Charmles was making at the time.<page>*: But it's quite a big thing that he was here, isn't it?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's my job to keep the castle safe,\nso I feel bad that I wasn't more on the ball.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Have you heard!? Seems Prince Charmles was so scared of doing the initiation that he hid himself in a barrel! Ridiculous, isn't it!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I bet the wedding would be off if the Princess of Trodain ever got wind of it!<page>*: ...Er, oh yeah, that was meant to be a secret! Don't tell anyone, okay!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: There were a lot of messengers coming from Trodain before the royal engagement was announced.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But lately there haven't been any at all.\nI don't know why they've stopped coming,\nbut I have a bad feeling about this.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What with Trodain being so far away across the ocean, it's not easy to make contact with them over there all that quickly.", true],
		["<se_def>*: King Clavius's throne room is just inside. Make sure you're on your best behaviour and you don't do anything to disturb His Highness.", true],
		["<se_def>*: How can we promise the Prince he'll be safe during the initiation without sending soldiers along to protect him?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's no good. I just can't see how it's possible.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King's terribly troubled at the moment because Prince Charmles refuses to carry out the initiation.<page>*: His Majesty is even considering having guards escort him.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But that would hardly prove his ability to succeed to the throne. If anything, it would prove just the opposite.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Lots of people have been coming to the castle to get permits for this year's bazaar.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It looks like there are going to be more stalls than ever. I can hardly wait to see the town square buzzing with contented shoppers!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Both King Clavius and his older brother Eltrio completed the initiation with no fear whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But Prince Charmles is such a coward, whining on about how lizards are so scary and frightening. He should be ashamed of himself!", true],
		["<se_high>*: This is the chamber of the late Queen.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ever since his wife died, King Clavius has been easier than ever on Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If King Clavius's older brother, Eltrio,\nhad had a son, he'd be the one doing the\nroyal initiation now.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But Eltrio gave up the throne and left Argonia, so leadership passed on to his younger brother.", true],
		["<se_def>*: As Prince of Argonia, Charmles has no choice but to complete the royal initiation. Even though he can't stand the sight of lizards...", true],
		["<se_high>*: It sounds like the Prince can't stand them, but I absolutely adore lizards. They're indispensable when it comes to black magic.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's hard for us royal magicians to understand why the Prince is so afraid of them, when we have no problems with them whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hm? A magic mirror? Yes, I've a feeling there's something like that among the royal treasures, but I can't be sure.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even if it is here in Argonia, you'll need the King's permission if you want to borrow it, or even lay eyes on it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I love being a guard. It's great fun, and the view's amazing. The only drawback is that it can get a bit chilly out here in the wind.", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's Prince Charmles's room there.\nI can't help but worry that he might try\nand run off again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But if you try to watch over him all the time, he moans and bawls like you wouldn't believe. Argh, this job will be the death of me!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I say! Who are you? I don't believe you're members of the castle staff.", true],
		["<se_def>*: How dare you enter the room of a royal prince without permission!? Do you not realise who I am!?", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Honestly! What a nerve! I could call the guards in an instant, you know!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: If you don't want to be manhandled by them, then I suggest you leave immediately!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: What are you still doing here!? You should leave now before I change my mind and stop treating you so nicely.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: I'll call the guards!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The locked room in the corner houses Argonia's royal treasures.", true],
		["<se_def>*: A little while back, a jester came along and broke in.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He didn't take anything, which was a relief, but he did manage to get away.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I doubt I'd have kept my job if he'd got hold of any treasure.", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Hm? The magic mirror?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Yes, I'm sure that was still there.\nNothing was taken, like I said.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder why on earth that jester bothered to break in if he didn't want to take anything!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: He could've easily got away with it. He could've taken his pick, in fact. It's all very odd.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Huh? Magic mirror? Hic! Never heard of it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wouldn't know about anything like that. Hic!<page>*: But if it's magic, you should try asking one of the royal magicians. Surely they'd know something... Hic!", true],
		["<se_high>*: A peddler told me that Trodain has been taken over by thorns and that the whole place is in ruins!", true],
		["<se_high>*: But it's all just some stupid rumour.\nI'm sure it's complete nonsense really.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Members of the public can only go in and out of the castle during the daytime. You'll have to come back tomorrow.", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is the entrance to Argonia Castle.\nYou can only go inside during the daytime.", true],
		["<se_def>*: When Prince Charmles caused all that fuss, the doors had to be kept locked night and day.<page>*: But that's all over now, so if you come back in the morning, I can let you in.", true],
		["<se_def>*: You came here on your own boat!? Goodness! You must have money coming out of your ears to be able to afford something like that!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you've been travelling the oceans,\nthen maybe you've been to Trodain?\nThe Princess there is promised to our very own Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Zzzzz...", true],
		["<se_low>*: Botheration! We may have found the Prince, but that still doesn't solve the problem. ...Hm!? What do you want!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: I've got all sorts of problems to deal with at the moment, so the last thing I need is to be disturbed in my own home!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I asked a friend of mine from the casino what happened over in Baccarat, and she said that Mr. Golding's house was broken into.<page>*: Someone was hurt, apparently.", true],
		["<se_high>*: She wouldn't tell me much more, apart from that it was Mr. Golding himself who was injured. That's why he's shut himself away in his house.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: Unless Charmles is brought to me here,\nthe initiation cannot go ahead.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: Can you cooperate with the castle staff and find him? Oh, that troublesome son of mine!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The Prince is probably still somewhere inside the castle. I've stationed guards at all the exits, so I very much doubt that he has escaped.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was holding on to the Prince's hand tightly so he wouldn't run away...", true],
		["<se_def>*: But he somehow slipped out of my grasp and rushed off!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I just saw one of the other politicians run by looking very pale. I wonder what was wrong with him?", true],
		["<se_high>*: ...Ah, Prince Charmles has run off again.\nI can't count the number of times he's done this now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: If only it wasn't a lizard Prince Charmles had to fight in the initiation, I'm sure he wouldn't be quite so afraid.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There seems to be an awful lot of fuss inside the castle. I wonder what's happened?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles has run away!?\nOh no! Not again! What a pain!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That Prince really is a joke sometimes. I can't imagine someone like him as our next King!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! I shouldn't really say things like that. Part of a guard's job is being discreet, after all. Just forget I said it.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Have you heard? Apparently, they've found Prince Charmles holed up on the third floor.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I tried to break down the door so that we could get at him, but it wasn't budging.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's not a lot we can do now.\nThat brat really is a pain sometimes!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles shook off one of my colleagues and ran back to his room.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I thought it was odd that he went so quietly in the first place. He was obviously plotting to run away again all along.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Huh, I really messed up this time.\nI was upstairs, so I couldn't respond quickly enough when the Prince ran away again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He wasn't in his room, so maybe he went out onto the second floor roof and crossed over to the west wing of the castle.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince just appeared out of nowhere and then disappeared into the west wing of the castle. I tried to catch him, but he slipped by.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He's so fast, it's maddening! He might even be quicker than a liquid metal slime!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I think the Prince is in there, but the door's locked so I can't get in. What is he up to!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently the Prince has run off and shut himself in one of the castle rooms.", true],
		["<se_high>*: At least we know where he is this time.\nWe had to search all over the place from dawn 'til dusk the last time he pulled this trick.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I suppose I'm quite lucky, being here when Prince Charmles is causing such a fuss. It'll be a good story to tell everyone when I get home!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince has run off again, but we know where he is this time so there's no need to keep the castle doors locked.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's no way he'll be able to get outside this time. But he's not very gracious in admitting defeat, unfortunately.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I could hardly believe my ears when I heard the Prince had run off again!", true],
		["<se_def>*: He's certainly got some spirit, that one,\nalways trying his luck like that!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Some of the others have gone to see what all the fuss is about, with Prince Charmles shutting himself away like that.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But I can't leave my post, so I can't go and enjoy the show! Bit of a shame, but there you are.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Prince Charmles has gone and locked himself in one of the servant's rooms now. He certainly seems determined this time.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If he really hates the idea of the initiation this much, maybe the King will just have to give up on the idea.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It'll take a lot to get the Prince out of that room again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I bet the only thing that'd do it would be if there was a lizard in there to scare him out!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wonder if Prince Charmles is okay?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Every now and then, lizards drop from the ceiling in the room he's in, you see. I doubt he'd like that much.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What am I going to do? The Prince says he'll bite his own tongue off if I try to open the door!", true],
		["<se_high>*: There are lizards living in the ceiling of the room below this one. Every now and then they drop down onto the floor below.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Of all the places for Prince Charmles to hide! He can't stand the sight of lizards!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't blame the Prince for feeling the way he does.<page>*: It's a bit unfair to expect him to fight lizards when he hates them so much, initiation or not.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw a huge one in that storeroom the other day, actually. I tried to catch it, but it got away.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder if it got in through a hole somewhere?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It sounds like there's a bit of a commotion going on downstairs. What's happened?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Of course, it had to be the Prince. I don't know why I bothered asking really. With all his nonsense, it'll be hard to keep on serving him.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince was just taken off by one of the soldiers, not two minutes ago!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The poor thing... No doubt King Clavius will be having a few strong words to say to him in the throne room about now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I heard a terrible scream from the room below. It sounds like it must've been Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I do wish the Prince would know when to stop this tomfoolery, and get on with the initiation like he's supposed to.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Hopefully he'll have learnt by now that trying to run away or hide just won't work. Hopefully...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Poor Prince Charmles was seized by the soldiers the second he ran out of that room.", true],
		["<se_def>*: And do you know what he said? That, if only it wasn't for that lizard, he could've stood at least another three days in there!", true],
		["<se_high>*: When Prince Charmles ran out of that room, he was in quite the most hysterical panic!\nHe really must hate lizards!", true],
		["<se_high>*: They caught Prince Charmles quickly this time, didn't they? Bit of a disappointment, really.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'd predicted he'd manage at least three days holed up in that room.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So they've got hold of Prince Charmles again?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe he'll mend his ways once King Clavius has given him a good talking-to...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Really!? They caught the Prince already!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: They won't keep hold of him long! He's got spirit, that one. He'll be off again before you know it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Did you know about the wasteland across the sea to the northwest of here? Nobody lives there.", true],
		["<se_def>*: People say that the shrine in the middle of it is filled with the darkest powers in the world.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's a place everyone's been going to for years to perform dark rites, apparently.<page>*: Well, the kind of people who go in for that sort of thing, I mean.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wish my shift would hurry up and end.\nI've got to go and see where the Prince has shut himself up.<page>*: Wouldn't miss the drama for the world!", true],
		["<se_def>*: What!? He's already come out!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, of all the rotten luck!\nI was looking forward to a good show...", true],
		["<se_def>*: It fills me with courage when I look at Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's nice to know there's someone out there more cowardly than me, you see! He makes me look good!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince was caught just now. I bet King Clavius is giving him a real dressing down!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince has been caught, but I doubt he'll be coming back to his room for a while.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I doubt the King will let him off the hook this time. He'll have to agree to the initiation before he's allowed to go free again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: DUMMY MES!", true],
		["<se_def>*: DUMMY MES!", true],
		["<se_high>*: The soldiers took Prince Charmles down to the throne room. He looked a bit green in the face, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_high>*: He really looked defeated this time.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Chancellor told me to wait here once I'd finished escorting the Prince. I wonder what my next orders will be.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was ordered to wait here for some reason.\nI wonder if this is something to do with the initiation.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe that rumour about having guards go along to protect the Prince was true...", true],
		["<se_def>*: The King wants privacy, so he ordered me\nnot to let anyone inside the throne room.\nAnyone apart from you, that is.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Go on then, in you go.\nThe King's waiting for you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: King Clavius ordered total privacy, so there's just him, the Prince and the Chancellor in the throne room at the moment.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He left instructions that you should be allowed in to join them, though.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The King tends to be very soft in how he deals with Prince Charmles.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He should really let him have it this time. But I fear he'll just let him off the hook, as usual.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: No doubt I'm the first king in history to make this ridiculous request for guards to be present at the royal initiation.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: But I lost my wife some time ago, and Charmles is all I have now. That, I admit, is one of the reasons why he MUST be brought back safely.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: If you fulfil this role satisfactorily, the magic mirror is yours. So please do your absolute utmost to protect him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I actually know that you've been chosen to guard the Prince during the initiation.", true],
		["<se_high>*: When you work so closely with the royal family, you sometimes find out things you'd rather not.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Looking after Prince Charmles isn't likely to be any easy task, so keep your chin up and good luck!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince was taken off by the Chancellor and some soldiers, and then he set off for the initiation not long afterwards.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder how they managed to persuade him to go through with it in the end? Do you know?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, but I'm speaking out of turn again! Someone in my position shouldn't be prying into things like that.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It looks like the Prince has finally faced up to his responsibilities.<page>*: I saw the Chancellor and some soldiers seeing him off on his initiation just now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Prince Charmles may be a coward, but it looks like even he couldn't escape his royal duty.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Well, I must admit to being rather surprised.<page>*: It seems Prince Charmles has left the castle to carry out that initiation he's been avoiding all this time.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I saw him leaving with my very own eyes! When I tell my mates I was here at the time, they'll be really impressed!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've got faith in Prince Charmles. I'm sure he'll defeat a lizard and bring back an Argon heart before long.", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is Prince Charmles we're talking about.\nMaybe it won't be him defeating the lizard,\nbut the lizard defeating HIM!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't believe it! Prince Charmles has set off for the royal initiation!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well, he must've had quite a change of heart! He was so against the idea before...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was watching from up here. I saw the soldiers seeing the Prince off and him walk across town.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There I was, sure he'd try to make a run for it again. But it looks like I was wrong.", true],
		["<se_low>*: King Clavius is a very brave man. I've no idea how he managed to raise such a cowardly son.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I wonder if there would've been such a carry-on had it been Eltrio's son who was supposed to be doing the initiation?", true],
		["<se_low>*: He might not have even had a son, mind,\nso there's no point thinking about that. Who knows what became of him after he abdicated...", true],
		["<se_high>*: People say that the bigger the Argon heart a prince brings back, the more powerful a king he'll become.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But to get a bigger Argon heart, don't you have to defeat a bigger Argon lizard?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm sure the Argonian royal treasure,\nthe magic mirror, has a proper name.\nI just can't quite bring it to mind.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I don't think anyone really knows, though. That's why we all just refer to it as the magic mirror. Keep it simple, I say!", true],
		["<se_def>*: My master, the old wizard, would probably know all there is to know about the magic mirror. But he's not at the castle any more.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He lost his sight, so he decided it was time to give up his position here at the castle.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince has set off for the initiation!? That's huge news!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Thanks for telling me! It's not easy to get hold of any information when you're stuck in a place like this.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There hasn't been any contact from Trodain for quite some time now. And yet we used to be in touch with them quite often.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So Prince Charmles has finally set off for the initiation...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I hope he finds his way back in one piece.\nHe's hardly the world's strongest warrior,\nafter all, so you can't help but worry.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I saw a short, portly young man being escorted to the town gates by the Chancellor and some soldiers earlier.\nCould that have been...!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Wow! That was the Prince!?\nHe was well-dressed and everything,\nbut he certainly didn't look like a prince!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I thought the Prince was off to the casino again, but it looks like I was wrong this time.", true],
		["<se_def>*: People are saying he's gone off to do the initiation! And on his own as well!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince is gonna have to fight an Argon lizard in the initiation. The big ones are s'posed to be really tough.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder if he's got what it takes?\nHe's not the bravest of people!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you go east out of town, you come to a mountain that belongs to the royal family. That's where the initiation takes place.", true],
		["<se_high>*: By the time the Prince gets back, the town square should be buzzing with people coming for the bazaar.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Being a warrior, I'd love to have the chance to fight an Argon lizard. But I'm no prince, so I'm not allowed in the royal hunting ground.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I heard that the Prince was taking royal guards with him to the initiation, but it looks like that was just a silly rumour.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Prince is goin' off to fight monsters all on himself!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw the Prince off when he left for the initiation, and I actually felt quite sorry for him.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The expression on his face! He looked like\na condemned man on his way to the gallows,\nthe poor thing!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I hope Prince Charmles will be all right. Think about his poor fianc\u00e9e, grieving for her betrothed who's been gobbled up by a lizard!", true],
		["<se_def>*: No, no, I mustn't talk like that!\nIt's not as if he's dead yet!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Charmles has finally woken up to his responsibilities as Prince of Argonia!\nI couldn't have hoped for better news!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I can hardly believe that Prince Charmles went off all on his own like that.\nI'm so impressed!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Three cheers for Prince Charmles!\nThree cheers for Argonia! Hip hip hooray!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was convinced we'd be sent along with the Prince as bodyguards.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I must admit, it seems I was wrong about Prince Charmles.<page>*: If he's brave enough to go off on his own like that, I've been doing him an injustice.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well, I suppose he's only doing what's expected of him by going to the initiation on his own.<page>*: But, still, it's been quite a while since Prince Charmles lived up to any kind of positive expectation! Well done him!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The future of Argonia lies in your hands now. Please make sure you don't let us down.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It might have been nice to give the Prince a big send off, but there wasn't enough time.<page>*: It would've been a perfect opportunity to make use of the banquet hall, too.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I'm praying that the poor, timid Prince doesn't get eaten alive by a lizard!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Someone at the castle told me that it's been weeks since they've had a messenger from Trodain.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Now everyone's starting to wonder if it's because his bride-to-be has discovered the Prince's true colours and wants to call the wedding off!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I mustn't say this too loudly, but I can't help worrying that Prince Charmles might not come out of this initiation alive.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I mean, he probably doesn't know one end of a sword from the other! Those lizards are going to have a field day!", true],
		["<se_low>*: There's a lot of noise outside.\nHas something happened?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Good grief! Prince Charmles has set off for the initiation!? I don't believe it!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I-Impossible...!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Everyone was saying how much the Prince hated the idea of the initiation. How can he have changed his mind so suddenly!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince of Argonia has finally set off for the initiation he was dreading so much.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There are always lots of weird things on sale at the bazaar that we can't normally buy here.<page>*: It's really good fun just to wander around looking at all the stalls!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I came early thinking there'd be a mad dash for permits for the bazaar, but it turned out to be as easy as pie!", true],
		["<se_low>*: None of the other peddlers I know are here either, so it looks like I'll be twiddling my thumbs until it finally opens.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Just standing in one spot all day is actually quite hard work. It was much more fun when we had to scour the castle for Prince Charmles!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I should think the Prince will be arriving at the royal hunting ground fairly soon.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ooh, the bazaar will be on soon! I've been so busy thinking about Prince Charmles up to now that I forgot all about it!", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Chancellor's son, Lorenzo, was disinherited for being too much of a playboy and never settling down and applying himself.", true],

		["<se_def>*: DUMMY MES", true],

		["<se_def>*: It's a relief that the Prince has finally gone ahead with the initiation. Hopefully he'll be able to save face for all that nonsense before.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh! Is it bazaar time again already? Excellent! I always try to sneak out of work for a while and have a look around.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hardly anyone ever comes here anyway. I'm sure it wouldn't matter if I skived off for a bit.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I heard the news the other day that the long period of mourning in Ascantha is finally over.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Our own King Clavius was naturally very upset indeed when he lost his wife. But not to the extent that he almost let the country fall apart.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Oh!? What are you doing here!? You're supposed to be overseeing the initiation at the royal hunting ground! Has something bad happened?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Don't lie to me! I can tell by your face that's not true! You should learn when teasing is appropriate and when it's most definitely NOT!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Well, that's good. But you must keep an eye on the Prince. Who knows what he'll get up to next...", true],
		["<se_def>*: It can get a bit cold up here at the top of the tower, but it's nothing like the snow country in the north. That place is one big block of ice!", true],
		["<se_def>*: You hear the news? Hic! The Prince's set off for the 'nitiation he was dreading... Hic!", true],
		["<se_def>*: An' on his own as well! Hic! We men are a proud bunch, y'see! Never want to lose face! Hic!", true],

		["<se_high>*: We aren't supposed to buy anything from them, but they always have such unusual things for sale.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Thanks for stopping to chat.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It can be a bit dull just standing here all night with no one to talk to.<page>*: I suppose that's the life of a guard though, really. I shouldn't be complaining to you about it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wish I could be like you, gallivanting all around the world with no roots and no cares.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah, it's you. So, what's the news?\nHow are things progressing with the Prince?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Everything's going according to plan, then? That's good to hear.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It doesn't make any difference to me if the Prince is here or not. I still have plenty of things to worry about. Hic!<page>*: Maybe that's why I've developed such a thirst...", true],
		["<se_low>*: We're really depending on you. Please do everything in your power to make sure it all works out well! Hic!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Was that Prince Charmles running by just then!? So does that mean he's completed the initiation!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw Prince Charmles running over towards the bazaar tents just now. You don't think he's chickened out of the initiation, do you?", true],
		["<se_def>*: The bazaar only takes place once a year, so if there's anything you like, you should make sure you buy it now.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Some of the things on sale can only be found here, you know.<page>*: So now's not the time for penny-pinching!\nIf you see something you want,\nyou'd better take the plunge!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's a little girl selling Yggdrasil leaves in that tent over there. She won't sell you more than one, though!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Hello! Welcome to the Yggdrasil leaf shop!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Now, let's see. One Yggdrasil leaf comes to 1000 gold coins. Easy-peasy! Would you like one?", true],

		["<se_high>*: Thank you! Let me put it in your bag for you.", true],

		["<se_high>*: Oopsie! I'm afraid you can't afford it!\nI can't reduce the price, so maybe you could come again when you've saved up?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh! You don't want one!? But that's not fair... Boohoo!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm sorry, but each group of people is only allowed one Yggdrasil leaf at a time.\nRules are rules!<page>*: If you ever lose the one you have, though, come back and I can sell you another one.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Boohoo...Ygg...Yggdrasil leaf...one for 1000 gold...uuhh...would you like one...boohoo...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Waaah! Waaah! Waaah!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I came here to do a bit of shopping with the mistress, but I'm so embarrassed I wish the ground would swallow me up whole...", true],
		["<se_high>*: I had no idea she liked to barter so much!<page>*: She even tried to knock down the price on medicinal herbs, which are so cheap they're almost free anyway! I nearly died!", true],
		["<se_high>*: The man in the weapon shop said that you can make a really cool axe by getting the moon's blessing on a normal golden axe!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The bazaar's always a winner.\nThey've got loads of weapons and armour\nyou can never get hold of anywhere else.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm not happy, not happy at all!\nThis is a bazaar! The whole idea of a bazaar\nis that you can bargain people down!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm sorry, madam, but I have a business to run. Bazaar or no bazaar, I can't afford to lower the price any further.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Don't you realise who I am!? I'm the Chancellor's wife! If you refuse to reduce the price this instant, I'll have your stall shut down!", true],
		["<se_def>*: She may be well-heeled, but she's as tight as a dangerous bustier! Fancy trying to get a reduction on medicinal herbs!", true],
		["<se_def>*: In all my years, I've never once seen anyone try to knock down the price on them!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw someone that looked just like Prince Charmles go up those stairs just now, but surely it wasn't really him...", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is my first year selling cooking spices.\nI thought it was worth a go, and I was right.<page>*: My stuff's selling like hot cakes! I'm going to bring even more things to sell next year!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Heh heh! Didn't think I'd be able to shift that loot for so much! Who says crime doesn't pay!? Oh! Er...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Never mind that, eh? Business is business!\nI've got plenty of other good stuff for sale.\nWhy don't you 'ave a gander?", true],
		["<se_high>*: The King's always out on the balcony looking across town with some weird glasses. I wonder if he's lost something?", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King's obviously anxious for Prince Charmles to come home.<page>*: Whenever he has a spare minute, he's always up on the balcony with his looking glass staring out over the gates.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Step right up, step right up! If you want something unique, this is the place! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Once it's sold, it's sold!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Watch out for dodgy traders selling stolen goods.", true],
		["<se_high>*: They charge ridiculous prices, so you're better off not dealing with them.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King's been out on the balcony with his looking glass again today. He must be worried about the Prince.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've been so busy watching the bazaar, I've let dozens of people into the castle without even looking at their faces!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! Maybe you could just forget I said that, eh?", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's a shame Prince Charmles couldn't make it back in time for the bazaar. I wonder if the initiation's going well...", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wanted to tell everyone at the castle that the initiation had been a success, but Prince Charmles absolutely forbade me to.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I suppose he probably wants to enjoy a bit of shopping at the bazaar before he makes the big announcement.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I'm absolutely rushed off my feet getting ready for this evening! I'd even accept a troll's help, if one offered!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It was the first time the Prince had ever stayed with us! I'm sure we weren't good enough for him! Oh, the shame!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Still, it's wonderful news that he succeeded with the initiation. King Clavius must be over the moon.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Meow.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I really love axes! And I like combinin' 'em in all sorts of ways!", true],
		["<se_low>*: My friend's a thief, see? And the other day I mixed his favourite tool with a battle-axe.", true],
		["<se_low>*: He was furious at me, though! Said I shouldn't have turned the tool he uses to make a livin' into a dumb axe! Can you believe that?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'd love to go and look around the bazaar,\nbut I hate crowded places.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Whenever the bazaar's on, the children come to me for more and more pocket money every day. We're hard pushed to make ends meet as it is!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe I was just seeing things...but I'm sure I saw the Prince running to the castle with a huge Argon heart in his hands.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Prince Charmles went back to the castle with a really big jewel in his hands. Do you think he bought it at the bazaar?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Prince Charmles is home at last. He had an absolutely enormous Argon heart with him as well! It's true!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The Goddess has answered my prayers. I was in church every day asking Her to spare the Prince from becoming a lizard's dinner!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's a huge fuss going on in the castle now that the Prince is back. To be honest, I was starting to think he'd never come home.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! Maybe you could just forget I said that, eh?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hey! Did you hear the news?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Incredible, eh!? It's a miracle he even made it back alive. I couldn't believe it when I saw the size of the Argon heart he was carrying!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince has finished the initiation and come home!", true],
		["<se_def>*: He's about to present the Argon heart to King Clavius in the throne room right now!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone's slacking off. I know they're happy to see the Prince back, but I don't really approve of them all leaving their posts like that.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It was as big as a jar! No, a barrel!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Waaah! Prince Charmles brought back an Argon heart that big!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I can't cook at a time like this! I'm far too excited! We must all celebrate the safe return of the Prince!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hm? You say the castle feels rather empty today?", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's because half the staff's skived off from their posts to swap gossip! Prince Charmles is all anyone can talk about!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's amazing that the Prince managed to bring back such a huge Argon heart. He hates lizards, after all...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles brought back an Argon heart that big!? A coward like him!? No way! If you're going to lie, at least make it believable!", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's true! I saw it for myself! It was even bigger than your helmet!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm not neglecting my work, oh no! I'm trying to figure out the size of the Argon heart the Prince brought back from the initiation.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's true, I tell you! I saw it! That Argon heart the Prince had was as big as a salamango!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder if that Argon heart the Prince brought back with him is real? Er, not that I'm doubting him or anything.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Go on through. The King left instructions to allow you to pass when you turned up.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I know I'll get to see it eventually, but I can hardly wait! I really want to get a look at that Argon heart the Prince brought back!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Oh, it's you <leader>! So what do you think!? I assume you saw my moment of glory!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: What a feeling! Watching everyone who used to disparage me having to eat their words is most refreshing! Ha ha hah!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you've come to see the King, he's over there looking at the view. It looks like he might have something on his mind.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Wow! That's huge! I can't believe Prince Charmles managed to get hold of something so big!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't know who it was, but someone said that the Argon heart Prince Charmles brought back is the biggest one ever!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's probably why the King's a little down in the dumps. I doubt he's happy to be trumped by his own son like that.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If the Argon heart the Prince brought back is that big, the lizard he defeated to get it must have been a giant!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah, it's you.\nThank you for all your hard work before.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Go and ask the King for your reward.\nAnd make sure you keep all of this hush-hush like we agreed, all right?", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's such a relief that the initiation is out of the way. It was causing us a real headache before. Your help was invaluable.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Don't worry, your secret's safe. I'm one of the ones who's meant to be in the know.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So the presentation ceremony in the throne room's over now. Excellent.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Is it true that the Argon heart the Prince brought back is even bigger than a barrel!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I knew it! It's just like I saw!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Hmm. I don't believe you! I'm sure it was!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder what the late Queen would say if she saw Prince Charmles overcome his fear of lizards like that...", true],
		["<se_def>*: It chokes me up just thinking about it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone else may be in a flap because of the Prince's homecoming, but I'm determined it should be business as usual. So...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Welcome to Argonia Castle!", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's an old book in the castle that talks about a giant bird called Empyrea.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It says she was so big, she created an enormous shadow over the land when she flew past. Don't you just love old books!? They're so romantic!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone's making far too much of a fuss over Prince Charmles. I mean, he just did what he had to do. Of course he was going to succeed!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles is just like in that saying...", true],
		["<se_def>*: You know, the one about the clever pig who pretends to be ill so the farmer won't slaughter him.<page>*: What was it...? \u2018To cheat the chop, the clever pig plays sick and saves his bacon!\u2019", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Or should I not be comparing royalty to a pig!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: After his performance at the initiation, my loyalty to the Prince has gone soaring from way down in the minuses all the way up to...<page>*: ...zero! Or is it way up in the minuses!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm going to make a real feast to celebrate the Prince's homecoming!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I never tire of looking at it. It's so nice to see the town buzzing like this.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently, the Prince is going to use the Argon heart he won in his bride's wedding ring.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But it's so huge! Her finger's sure to break if she has to wear that thing!", true],
		["<se_high>*: When I next get the chance to take some holiday, I'm going to see the old wizard in the western forest.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He used to work here at the castle and he was the most senior of us all. But now he's retired.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's a place right up in the north where it's so cold all year round that even your snot freezes up!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's an ancient royal treasure that dates back all the way to the Godbird Empyrea's time.", true],
		["<se_def>*: That room in the corner is the royal vault, but no one's allowed in without explicit permission from the King.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There was a tent at one of the bazaars a long time ago with monsters on show. But their keeper was so cruel.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The poor things, being treated like that.\nThe old wizard at the castle paid out a fortune to take them off his hands.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He obviously found it too upsetting to watch. When he left the castle some time later, the monsters went with him!<page>*: He lives a sort of hermit's life now in the western forest.", true],
		["<se_def>*: When the old wizard was here, he did a lot of research into the treasures housed in the royal vault.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But then his eyes went, so he left the castle and went to live deep in the forest to the west of here. He's become a bit of a hermit really.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone's really relieved that the Prince is back safe and sound. To be honest, I was starting to think he'd never come home...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! Maybe you could just forget I said that, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ooh, you're <IF_SOLO>a traveller<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>travellers<ENDIF_SOLO> as well, are you?\nDo you ever try to get home once in a while?", true],
		["<se_low>*: King Clavius had a brother called Eltrio, but he left the country to go on his travels one day and never came back!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King would never admit to it, but I'm sure he still thinks about his brother a lot.", true],
		["<se_low>*: King Clavius had a brother called Eltrio, but he left the country to go on his travels one day and never came back!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King would never admit to it, but I'm sure he still thinks about his brother a lot.", true],
		["<se_low>*: When King Clavius was a lad and he came back from the initiation, his clothes were in a right state.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But Prince Charmles hardly had a hair out of place. Very odd that.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Princess Medea is going to marry Prince Charmles! That's what the woman in the inn said.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles came back and presented an Argon heart to the King!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: So he really is back... I'd be in trouble if I got caught skiving off, but I hardly feel like returning to my post at a time like this!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Argon heart the Prince brought back is supposed to be really big. Maybe I'll go over to the castle and have a look when I get a chance.", true],
		["<se_low>*: So Prince Charmles has finally gone through with the initiation. The future looks bright for Argonia again at last!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Business is always booming at this time of year. Whenever the bazaar's on, I'm so busy that I hardly have time to blink!", true],
		["<se_high>*: It all seems a bit sudden to me. It's hard to believe that Prince Charmles managed to complete the initiation all by himself.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wonder if he got someone to help him out on the quiet...", true],
		["<se_def>*: You know that stone the Prince brought back from the 'nitiation? Hic! Well, they say it's bigger than a bar! Hic! ...Or was it barrel...?", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's always a sort of holiday feeling in the air during the bazaar. I can hardly wait for each new day to roll around!<page>*: I wish tomorrow would hurry up and come!", true],
		["<se_high>*: There are so many people about during the daytime that it's a bit lonely seeing the place so empty at night.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone else seems to believe it, but I'm not so sure Charmles could've defeated that lizard all by himself.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If I come across anyone who's up to no good, I'll soon sort him out with my new weapon here! Yaaah!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If I keep patrollin' like this, I'll be able to catch any thief out there with his eye on a freebie.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Zzzz...one million...gold coins...all mine! Zzzz...", true],
		["<se_low>*: More big profits again for me today!\nAnd more again tomorrow!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You can't beat a nice drink after a hard day's work.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw the Argon heart Prince Charmles brought back earlier today. It was incredible!", true],
		["<se_def>*: They're putting it on display for the public, so if you want to have a look, just come to the castle in the morning.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw some of the traders having a drink during the day, earlier. I was so jealous that I almost had to arrest them!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oops! Maybe you could just forget I said that, eh?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Purrr...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Zzzz...Yggdrasil...zzzz...", true],

		["<se_low>*: Zzzz...I'll...sell more...than you...zzzz...", true],
		["<se_low>*: If I don't try an' get hold of more stuff fast, I'll run outta things to sell before the bazaar finishes!", true],
		["<se_low>*: When King Clavius was a lad and he came back from the initiation, his clothes were in a right state.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But Prince Charmles hardly had a hair out of place. Very odd that.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Dearie me. I just can't get to sleep tonight.\nI'll be exhausted tomorrow.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Uhh, do me a favour and find someone else to talk to! I've got an early morning tomorrow.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's a shabby-looking man asleep outside the mansion. I just can't relax with him there!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm sure he's planning to creep in here and steal something when we're all asleep.", true],
		["<se_low>*: No one must be allowed to find out that the Prince was assisted during the initiation! Ohhh, but keeping secrets is just so...DIFFICULT!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Waah!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You gave me a fright! Thank the Goddess it's only you! Make sure you don't tell anyone about the Prince, all right?", true],
		["<se_low>*: We must all keep the details of the initiation to ourselves. We'll take this secret to our graves with us, do you hear!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: My husband is the Chancellor...zzzz...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hm, what shall I buy at the bazaar tomorrow?", true],
		["<se_high>*: My husband keeps buying all sorts of rubbish at the bazaar. He's hardly setting a good example for the children!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Zzzz...zzzz...", true],
		["<se_high>*: I saw Lorenzo the other day, you know.\nBut he said he wasn't going to go home because he's too scared of his dad.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I didn't want to spend good money on a bed at the inn, so I'm spending the night out here instead.<page>*: But I'm far too cold to get any sleep!\nNow I feel silly...", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: The magic mirror is in the royal vault on the fourth floor. You are free to take it whenever you wish.<page>King Clavius: I have already instructed the guards to admit you.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: And I will keep this Argon heart.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: It might prove useful when I need to remind Charmles of his foolhardiness.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The King has given orders that you're to be allowed into the royal vault whenever you wish. It's that room there in the corner.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The mirror itself appears to be intact. So you should be able to \u2018recharge\u2019 it, so to speak, by exposing it to the right kind of magic.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The man who taught me was a wizard, and an expert in magical treasures. I'm sure he would know how to re-energise the mirror.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Unfortunately, he is retired. Now he spends his days in seclusion, in his home deep in the western forest.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Who are you anyway? How come you managed to get permission to go inside the royal vault?", true],
		["<se_def>*: No, never mind. I'm sure you can't tell a nobody like me. No doubt it's some very deep, important reason.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's an ancient royal treasure that dates back all the way to the Godbird Empyrea's time.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If Eltrio had become King and had a son,\nit would be him who'd be marrying Princess Medea now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It may have been King Clavius's idea to fulfil the old promise between Trodain and Argonia and have their children marry...", true],
		["<se_low>*: But I've no doubt that Eltrio would've done exactly the same thing had he been King.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Ah, it's you, <leader>! You just caught me thinking about my wife-to-be, the delicious Princess Medea! Hu hu huh!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: You were quite helpful during the initiation, so it would be churlish of me not to arrange a special invitation for you to our wedding.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: And you'd better be grateful! Commoners like you can usually only dream of attending a royal wedding.<page>Prince Charmles: You may call me...\u2018Charmles the Benevolent\u2019!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Argon heart the Prince brought back has been moved to the first floor so that the public can view it.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The King informed me about what had happened. Now I understand why he looked so uncomfortable at the presentation ceremony.", true],
		["<se_low>*: We went to all that trouble arranging bodyguards for him, and this is how he repays us! The King must be devastated by such a betrayal.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: If I remember rightly, you wanted the magic mirror to help you in your quest to defeat Dhoulmagus, didn't you?", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: If only Charmles could find something to motivate him like that... Although it would depend on what it was, of course.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: My older brother, Eltrio, fell in love with a woman and gave up the throne and his country to be with her.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: But what I want for Charmles is for him to have a sense of purpose that drives him to serve Argonia.<page>King Clavius: Rather than just to serve himself, like Eltrio did.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I really want to see the Argon heart the Prince brought back. But I can't possibly leave my post.", true],
		["<se_high>*: They're going to use that Argon heart to make the Prince's wedding ring. But that thing's so huge, it could make a hundred wedding rings!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles is stronger than I thought. He must've had to defeat an enormous lizard to get hold of a heart that big.", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is the Argon heart the Prince brought back from the initiation. You can look, but please don't touch.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I was only away from the castle for a little while, but I missed the Prince coming back from his initiation. Of all the rotten luck!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There are some people here claiming to be representatives of Mr. Golding, but the King is refusing to see them.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Prince Charmles has a bit of a thing for gambling, you see, so the King despises everything about Baccarat for leading him astray.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Do you enjoy getting in the way, or something!? Don't waste my time!\nLet me see the King!", true],
		["<se_def>*: No way! Go home! King Clavius would never deign to speak to that Golding lowlife's lackeys!", true],
		["<se_def>*: You're as stubborn as a mule!\nWe have to see the King, I tell you!<page>*: If we're going to take revenge for what happened to Mr. Golding, we need that<endash>", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh! It's you!\nDidn't we meet before at the Dark Ruins?", true],
		["<se_high>*: We came here to see if King Clavius would lend us one of the royal treasures, but we're not having any luck.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I never imagined we wouldn't even be able to make it past the door!", true],
		["<se_high>*: We came here to see if King Clavius would lend us one of the royal treasures, but we're not having any luck.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I never imagined they'd just turn us away at the door!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Actually, I heard something about the casino in Baccarat being closed.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Prince loves to gamble, so I bet he'll\nbe disappointed when he hears the news.\nI'm quite disappointed myself, to be honest.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Eh!? What was that?\nYou've lost one of your friends?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Are you talking about the girl with the big bosom!? She's already left.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I spotted her about to leave the inn before the sun had even come up, so I asked her where she was going.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And she said she was going north.\nI'm fairly sure there's a checkpoint up there.", true],
		["<se_high>*: That friend of yours with the big bosom has already left.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I spotted her about to leave the inn before the sun had even come up, so I asked her where she was going.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And she said she was going north.\nI'm fairly sure there's a checkpoint up there.", true],
		["<se_low>*: That girl you were with before left on her own, early this morning. Did you have a fight or something?", true],
		["<se_low>*: If you want to patch things up, you should do it as soon as you can. The longer you leave these things, the harder it gets.", true],
		["<se_low>*: No? Well, that shows how much I know!\nI was convinced you must've had a row!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Meoooow.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you go northeast out of Argonia, you come to a bridge by a waterfall. There's a stunning view to be had there.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you cross the bridge and keep going north, you come to a checkpoint. Nothing particularly special about that, though.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Welcome to Argonia. You've come at a good time! The bazaar's on at the moment.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's a town called Arcadia beyond the northern checkpoint. It's famous for its stone statues.", true],
		["<se_def>*: In fact, it's safe to say that almost all the statues in the world are made in Arcadia.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I just can't believe it. Mr. Golding, the owner of the Baccarat casino, murdered like that...", true],
		["<se_def>*: He once defeated a bear with his bare hands! It's hard to imagine a man that strong being killed by a no-good thief.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I was an adventurer too, in my younger years. But it wasn't all it was cracked up to be. Maybe it's because we didn't have any women with us.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh dear! I'm afraid I've just sold my last item! Sorry about that.", true],
		["<se_high>*: DUMMY MES", true],
		["<se_high>*: Prince Charmles has become really quiet and serious since the initiation. It's weird.", true],
		["<se_high>*: In the past, he was always sneaking out of the castle and going off for a bit of fun at the casino in Baccarat.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Argon heart the Prince brought back from the initiation is currently on display on the first floor.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Argon heart Prince Charmles brought back from the initiation is just as big as everyone said!", true],
		["<se_high>*: They've put it on public display over at the castle. Why don't you go and have a look?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've been informed that some of the traders from the bazaar are sleeping here at night without permission. It's outrageous!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Although, with the inn full, I suppose they don't have much choice really. It would be a little harsh to order them to sleep out in the open.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've finally managed to give those employees of Mr. Golding the royal brush-off.", true],
		["<se_def>*: They were an insistent bunch! I wonder what it was they wanted. I supposed I should've asked at the time really.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's a land beyond the northern check[-]point that's covered in snow all year round.\nJust thinking about it's enough to make my snot freeze!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Wow!\nSo this is the Argon heart the Prince won...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe it's just sheer relief at the initiation being over, but the Prince doesn't seem to have the energy to do anything at the moment.<page>*: All he does is eat and sleep.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's funny, but he seemed happier and more full of beans when he was still trying to get out of doing it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I keep waiting and waiting, but there's still no peep out of Trodain. Has the Prince's wedding been called off or something?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Now that the Prince has stopped causing problems, I can work on my training all day, every day, without being disturbed.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The staircase from the roof on the second floor leads to the iron-barred room.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently, there's a treasure chest in there...", true],
		["<se_def>*: But the door's locked, so you can't get in!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's a bit boring being posted here, but at least it's better than the northern checkpoint.", true],
		["<se_def>*: King Clavius's throne room is through that door. Make sure you're on your best behaviour and don't do anything to disturb His Highness.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I wonder why King Trode has stopped sending his messengers over?", true],
		["<se_low>*: ...You don't think that rumour's true!?", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: Ah, <leader>, it's been a while. Was the magic mirror you wanted so desperately of any help to you?", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: Well, that's excellent news. Now I can rest safe in the knowledge that I didn't part with a royal treasure for no reason.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: ...It wasn't? Well, don't think you can exchange it for another reward!", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: I haven't brought up the matter of the Argon heart with Charmles yet.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: So make sure you don't tell him that I know the truth, all right?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I always keep everything I hear at the castle to myself.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Sorry!? What would happen if I told someone!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: People with loose tongues don't leave the castle alive. I risk my life doing this job!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm too busy with work to go and buy anything at the bazaar.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't know who it was, but someone said that the Argon heart Prince Charmles brought back is the biggest one ever!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's probably why the King's a little down in the dumps. I doubt he's happy to be trumped by his own son like that.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The casino in Baccarat has been reopened at last.", true],
		["<se_def>*: When the Prince heard the news, he tried to sneak out of the castle and head over there straight away. But he got caught again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wonder if that mud mannequin the wizard befriended is doing okay...", true],
		["<se_def>*: No doubt he's still trumpeting away merrily and making the air unbreathable!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Oh, it's you, <leader>. You look well.\nNot like me. I'm bored out of my mind!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Father's been acting a bit off lately as well. Whenever he looks at me, he always seems to be scowling.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: It's really quite unsettling, and I haven't the foggiest what's wrong with him. He's an impossible one to read, my father.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Oh, it's you, <leader>. You look well.\nNot like me. I'm absolutely exasperated!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Why? Well, of all the nuisances, I've been forbidden from going to the casino in Baccarat.<page>Prince Charmles: It's been closed for an age and I was so looking forward to going again!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: I've tried all the tricks I know, but they keep catching me every time I try to slip out. Botheration!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's my job to guard the royal vault nowadays, but I used to be a sailor.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I travelled all over the world looking for Captain Crow's treasure, but I never did manage to find it.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Welcome to Argonia. You've come at a good time! The bazaar's on at the moment. Although the stalls are all closed now because it's nighttime.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I saw that girl leaving the inn early in the morning.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It was quite odd really. She was walking along mumbling about something being a pity.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hic! If you go northeast out of Argonia,\nthere's this bridge by a waterfall.\nNice view there. Hic!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you cross the bridge and keep going north, there's a pointcheck too. Hic!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That's it! Arcadia! I'll go through the northern checkpoint and start a new life in Arcadia!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Then maybe I'll be able to get her out of my mind. Why is it always me that gets dumped!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I can only allow you inside the castle during the day. Come back tomorrow if you've got business here.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I don't know what's wrong with me...\nI keep remembering things I'd rather forget,\nand they're keeping me awake all night!", true],
		["<se_high>*: The master of the house is the Chancellor of Argonia, and he's exhausted from all the hard work he's been doing.<page>*: Please try not to disturb him when he's resting.", true],
		["<se_low>*: There's been no contact at all from Trodain, where the Prince's intended lives. Whatever is going on!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Sorry. I'm sure that's no concern of yours.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was so shocked to hear that Golding was murdered.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I actually knew him, you know.\nHe was a guest at our wedding.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently Mr. Golding's funeral was very low-key, with just a few close family and friends.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Cash and Carrie must be devastated to have lost their father like that.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Well, well! So you've made up at last!", true],
		["<se_low>*: The last time you all stayed here, <IF_MALE>the young lady<ELSE_NOT_MALE>you<ENDIF_MALE> went off on <IF_MALE>her<ELSE_NOT_MALE>your<ENDIF_MALE> own, so I knew you'd had a fight.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Oh! You hadn't!? Well, that shows how much I know! I was convinced you must've had a row.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Oh well. Whatever it was, at least you're all back travelling together again now, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>*: I'm always so busy at this time of year that I hardly have time to blink! I'd even accept a troll's help, if one offered!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh, now what do I do!?\nThere's no room at the inn.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Well, there is, but I don't want to share a room with a perfect stranger! (Sigh.)\nOh well...strange bedfellows and all that...", true],
		["<se_low>*: The bazaar finished a bit earlier than planned this year.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You remember that day when the sky turned red? Well, the bazaar was called off right after that.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Chancellor who lives up on the hill suddenly disappeared the other day.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The house is completely empty and he's nowhere to be seen. Maybe he's been spirited away or attacked by thieves or...<page>*: Well I don't know, but it doesn't look good.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The bazaar's finished now, but some of the traders are still here. They've set up their stalls in the building to the left of the castle.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Some of the people who were looking at the sky when it burnt red died from the shock of it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Now everyone's afraid to set foot outdoors, and we're all really on edge.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's not just the Chancellor who's gone missing, you know. His wife and the maid have gone as well.", true],
		["<se_def>*: DUMMY MES", true],
		["<se_high>*: The initiation's over now, so you'd think they'd be setting a date for the Prince's wedding. But no one seems to be doing anything about it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: When the sky went red the other day, maybe it was the Goddess giving her blessing to Prince Charmles and Princess Medea's wedding...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I suppose it's unlikely, though. I mean, whoever heard of a blood-red blessing like that? No, it was more likely to be a curse.", true],
		["<se_def>*: One of my friends who works at the castle plucked up the courage to go and investigate the Chancellor's house.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wouldn't go anywhere near the place myself. I'd be too worried about getting spirited away like the Chancellor.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ohhh. I just don't believe it...", true],
		["<se_def>*: My friend was out peddling his wares when\na monster came along and ate him alive!\nIt's so sad, so sad...", true],
		["<se_high>*: DUMMY MES", true],
		["<se_def>*: The casino in Baccarat's reopened, but Prince Charmles hasn't tried to go there once.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He must be too scared to leave the castle.\nThe monsters have been a bit on the fierce side lately, you see.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's a lot quieter here now that the bazaar's finished.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Although, some of the traders still haven't gone home yet. They've got their stalls out in the building next door.", true],
		["<se_low>*: There haven't been many travellers like you around lately. It's been a bit difficult trying to earn a living.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Must be because of the monsters getting tougher. Makes my business tougher too.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Meow.", true],
		["<se_low>*: How frightening! I hear everyone over at the Chancellor's house has been spirited away!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I hope that doesn't happen to me!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Everyone's going on about how the Chancellor's disappeared, but I bet he just did a runner because he couldn't handle his work.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I think the Chancellor was really worried about why there were no messengers coming from Trodain any more.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wouldn't be surprised if he'd run away to escape the stress of it all.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Isn't dinner ready yet?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Mr. Golding's children have become the new managers of the casino in Baccarat.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Those two used to fight like cat and dog.\nI wonder how they managed to patch things up in the end?", true],
		["<se_def>*: We had so many complaints about the bazaar closing early, that we had to let the traders set up their stalls in this building instead.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I never knew there was a castle that could float in the sky like that...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I still can't really believe it, but I saw it with my own eyes so I suppose I'll have to.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Welcome to Argonia.\nThe King's throne room is on the second floor.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ooh, looks like we have a stranger in our midst!", true],
		["<se_low>*: This city's amazin'!\nI ain't never seen a castle that big!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hardly anyone comes to see the Argon heart the Prince won at the initiation any more...", true],
		["<se_def>*: So you can get a good look at it from any angle you want now! No need for all that pushing and shoving like before!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Now that there aren't so many traders about, I'm having quite a hard time getting hold of ingredients.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I went over to the Chancellor's house in the middle of the night to see if I could get a clue to where he's disappeared to.<page>*: It was a bit of a test of courage,\nI can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well, I went upstairs and you wouldn't believe what I saw! There was this really strange blue light shining from the dressing table!", true],
		["<se_def>*: That house is definitely haunted!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Did you hear about Trodain? It's been overrun by thorns and the place is in ruins!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I suppose that means Prince Charmles and Princess Medea's engagement is in ruins now as well...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Trodain stopped sending messengers here,\nso we sent one of ours over to them.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But when he got there, he found the place\nin ruins and overrun by giant thorns!\nFull of monsters as well!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Things have been a bit shaky lately.\nYou should be careful, especially if you're ever walking around at night.", true],
		["<se_high>*: What a terrible shock! No messengers have been coming from Trodain because the place is in ruins!", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's true! We sent one of our own messengers there and he saw it with his own eyes!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The King's throne room is inside.\nBe sure not to disturb His Majesty in any way.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If only the Chancellor were here.\nHis wise words would be invaluable now.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: Ah, it's you. I'm afraid you've caught me at a rather bad time. You see, we're in the middle of two rather large crises.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: The first is that we've discovered Trodain in ruins, and no one seems to know the where[-]abouts of King Trode and Princess Medea.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: The second is that my very own Chancellor has disappeared and no one seems to know his whereabouts either!", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: It's at times like these that I really wish Eltrio was still around.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The messenger we sent to Trodain reported back that he couldn't find the bodies of King Trode or Princess Medea anywhere in the castle.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So there's still a chance that they survived whatever it was that happened there.", true],
		["<se_high>*: King Clavius is handsome enough, but his brother Eltrio was really, really handsome!", true],
		["<se_high>*: He left Argonia years ago though.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Trodain's in ruins and no one knows if King Trode and Princess Medea are alive or dead.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Whatever's going to become of the Prince's wedding now...?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I looked through some old books to see if I could get a clue as to why the sky turned red, but I didn't really get anywhere.", true],
		["<se_high>*: They all mentioned a \u2018Lord of Darkness\u2019, though. I wonder what that's all about?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Long, long ago, the world was on the brink of destruction.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The sky turned red then as well.\nI wonder if that's just a coincidence...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Our soldiers should be guarding the northern checkpoint, but apparently it's been left unmanned.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's an absolute disgrace! A soldier shouldn't desert his post like that! Grrr!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's rather dull when Prince Charmles is this quiet.", true],
		["<se_def>*: We'll have to get him back to his old self, running and hiding and shutting himself away! He certainly kept us all on our toes!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Waaaah! Tell me it isn't true!", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Can you believe it!? Trodain is in ruins!\nWhat about my wedding!?", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: I can't be bothered to do anything now,\nnot even sneak out and go to the casino.\nAll I want to do is shut myself away.<page>Prince Charmles: But even that's not as much fun as it used to be!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's a book...three words...first word...sounds like...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, sorry. I didn't notice you there.\nI was playing charades.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's not much fun playing charades on your own, though. Bit too easy...", true],
		["<se_def>*: One morning, we discovered that everyone in the Chancellor's house up on the hill had disappeared.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Something must have happened there during the night. But what...!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: The square looks so empty with the bazaar finished. It feels quite eerie at night.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It looks like that peddler was right. He said Trodain was in ruins and I didn't believe him, but now we know it's true.", true],
		["<se_high>*: When their messengers stopped coming here, one of our men was sent over there to find out what was going on.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And when he got there, he found Trodain in total chaos, overrun by monsters and everything!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I used to enjoy the odd quiet moment on my own of a night, but now I just can't seem to relax.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've always been able to hear the monsters howling beyond the castle walls from time to time, but lately they're making a constant racket.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's quite unnerving to think that it's not just people living out there, but scary monsters as well.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Waaargh!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Zzzz...Yggdrasil...zzzz...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ah-phew, ah-phew...", true],
		["<se_low>*: I really love axes! And I like combinin' 'em in all sorts of ways!", true],
		["<se_low>*: My friend's a thief, see? And the other day I mixed his favourite tool with a battle-axe.", true],
		["<se_low>*: He was furious at me, though! Said I shouldn't have turned the tool he uses to make a livin' into a dumb axe! Can you believe that?", true],
		["<se_low>*: I've reached a ripe old age now, so I might not have long left.", true],
		["<se_low>*: When I think that I might close my eyes and never wake up again, it makes me too scared to go to sleep!", true],
		["<se_high>*: My friend went to the Holy Isle of Neos, and still hasn't come back. It's been ages now as well.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Some say there's a lovely, generous lady out there who'll do you a puff-puff for free.", true],
		["<se_def>*: You can't beat a good puff-puff. It feels so good having your face sandwiched between two big, soft...oh...don't get me started!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Darling!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Whew, that was close!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Well, er, anyway, people say it feels very nice.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hm? Sounds like the kids have finally stopped making a racket and fallen asleep at last.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's a relief to make it through another day without anything unusual happening.", true],
		["<se_high>*: We don't know when the sky might turn red and kill people again, after all.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ah-phew, ah-phew...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Argh! You gave me a fright!", true],
		["<se_high>*: But I'm awake now. Maybe this time I'll manage to stay up until morning!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Sorry, but the stall's closed now.\nYou'll have to come back tomorrow.", true],
		["<se_def>*: How ridiculous! Everyone got into such a flap about the Chancellor disappearing, but he'd just gone on holiday, that's all!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently, the Chancellor had just gone off on his holidays. Not even King Clavius knew about it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Sounds a bit fishy to me, though.\nI'm sure there must be more to it than that.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I feel really stupid now when I remember\nhow ridiculous I was about the Chancellor.\nThinking he'd been spirited away, of all things!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Maybe I ought to go off on a secret trip,\njust like the Chancellor did.", true],
		["<se_low>*: No, I'd better not. People might get the wrong idea and think I'd lost my marbles!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's weird, but no one seems to know where the Chancellor went on his holiday. And that's not the only thing...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Usually when he comes back from a trip, he's full of stories. Where he went, what he saw, what he ate, and all the rest of it.<page>*: But this time he's not said a word.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Chancellor probably let his hair down a bit while he was away, and did a few things he doesn't want us to know about.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I bet that's why he won't tell anyone about his trip.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh, it's you!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Thanks to you, I managed to escape being made into a stew! ...Maid stew! Yuck!", true],
		["<se_high>*: We don't want to tell people we were caught by monsters, so we're saying that we were off on our holidays.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It would be handy if you could go along with it as well. We don't want to worry people.", true],
		["<se_high>*: That mirror upstairs still glows blue during the night! It's so eerie!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was sure that the Chancellor had been spirited away by the ghost that haunts his mansion.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It doesn't matter now, anyway.\nAt least he's safe.", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Chancellor's safely back with us again, so now we can focus on what to do about Trodain.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Oh, it's you again.\nThank you for before.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But now we've got this problem of Trodain being in ruins to attend to. It's non-stop!", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: It sounds like you were the <IF_SOLO>one<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>ones<ENDIF_SOLO> who saved the Chancellor.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: So this is the second time you've been of assistance.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: I'm afraid I really dislike being in people's debt.", true],
		["<se_low>King Clavius: I'll be sure to redress the balance when an opportunity presents itself.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It was such a mystery for a while,\nbut then it all ended without much ado.\n...What am I talking about?", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Chancellor disappearing, of course.\nThey say he just went on holiday,\nbut it sounds a bit strange to me.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Just a few minutes later, and I'd have been a troll's dinner. I hope I never have to go through that again!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ah-phew...", true],
		["<se_high>*: The mistress refused to sleep in the same room as that mirror, so now I have to sleep in here instead.", true],
		["<se_high>*: They should just get rid of it, but they say it's too valuable to throw away!", true],
		["*: I don't want to be made into a maid stew!\nI don't want to die here!", true],
		["*: Eeeek! You there! Help us!", true],
		["*: I can't die before I've seen my beloved son, Lorenzo, again!", true],
		["*: You have to help us! We'll be a troll's dinner at this rate! Can't you overpower them?", true],
		["*: Fee! Fie! Foe! Yum! \u266a\nJuicy humans in my tum! \u266a", true],
		["The boss troll is so engrossed in his cooking that he doesn't notice he has company.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Wow! So this is the bazaar!\nNow I know I'm in the city!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It makes that jailbreak well worth the bother!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was doing a bit of research into alchemy, and I found something interesting. Well, interesting to me anyway...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently, some items can be made with not just one but two different recipes.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So that means there's more than one way to make them!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I heard a rumour that there's an undiscovered island out there somewhere that's not on any maps.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Isn't that just so romantic!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh! You're just like my husband. He's got no idea when it comes to romance either!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I knew you'd agree. Travellers always have a bit of a romantic side to them.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Heh heh heh! I dunno where to start wiv this many people to PICK an' choose from!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Can't wait for tonight to roll round...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'll never forget it. I was walking the shores of Lake Argon in the middle of the night once, and there he was, next to the sign post.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It was the strangest thing I've ever seen!\nA half-naked man! And he came after me\nwith an axe! I was sure my number was up!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I came all the way from the stonemason's town in the north and queued up at the tedious checkpoint to get here in time for the bazaar.", true],
		["<se_def>*: And now that I'm here, I may as well have a good look around the castle and make the most of it.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's surprising how many adventurers don't know this, but it's quite difficult to inflict damage on elemental monsters with a normal attack.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But the way to get around that is tension.\nIf you psyche yourself up enough,\nyou can make easy work of them!", true],
		["<se_low>*: There's a really big beach over the mountains to the south of here.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The royal family go there on holiday\nevery summer and live on a ship.\nOh, if only I had a ship!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It's amazin' bein' in the city! Look at all these people still about, even though it's the middle o' the night!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It makes that jailbreak well worth the bother!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oi, wot you doin' sneakin' up on me like that!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I ain't 'angin' about 'ere so I can break inta their 'ouse, y'know.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So don't get the wrong idea, awright!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm intending to wait here all night until daybreak.", true],
		["<se_def>*: That way, I'll be here the second the bazaar opens in the morning!", true]
