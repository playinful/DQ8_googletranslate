		["<se_high>*: Marek wasn't in? Oh, I do hate it when he goes off like this. What would happen if I fell ill now, with him away!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: He's supposed to be the town doctor, so he shouldn't just disappear on a whim!", true],
		["<se_low>Mayor: Where would Marek be if he's not in his room, you say?", true],
		["<se_low>Mayor: Hmm... I'm afraid he rather keeps himself to himself. I don't know where he came from or how he lives his life.", true],
		["<se_low>Mayor: One does wonder where he picked up all that knowledge about herbs. He's a bit of a mystery man, really.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Looks like you didn't manage to find Marek, then?", true],
		["<se_low>*: He does sometimes go out of town. Maybe he's not in Orkutsk at the moment.", true],

		["<se_low>Mayor: Our ancestors used to live in the southern mountains where they were charged with the task of protecting some ancient ruins.", true],

		["<se_low>Mayor: Nobody knows anything about the old ruins any more.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah, so Marek goes on those trips outside town to cultivate his herbs!", true],

		["<se_low>*: I've had enough! I'm gonna refuse to sell him any weapons from now on!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It sounds like Marek managed to get hold of some nook grass. It's great stuff for making you resistant to the cold.", true],
		["<se_def>*: You can get crazy prices for it out here in a place as cold as Orkutsk. People can't get enough of it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Next time I meet him, I'll see if he won't let me have some to sell in my shop.", true],

		["<se_low>*: No idea, eh? Well, it is an unusual herb, so I don't think many people know about it.", true],
		["<se_low>*: ...Apchkhi!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I feel all faint. And I'm so c-c-cold! I'm dying, DYING!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Please, Dr. Marek. Hurry...", true],

		["<se_def>*: No, of course there wasn't! I must've been seeing things. Bit overtired, I suppose.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've been working all hours lately. Maybe I should get Marek to make me an energy booster.", true],

		["<se_def>*: That's good. So where is he now?", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Oh! He's gone to visit someone's grave?<page>*: Is it the anniversary of someone's death then? That explains why he was in such a hurry to get away.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh-yo-yoy! So he's gone missing again!? Sometimes I think that man causes more headaches than he cures!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Am I lost again? No, no! I'm just enjoying a nice walk.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I thought that a bit of a walk every day might help to reduce the size of my beer belly.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oy-yoy! Why do you look so down in the dumps?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Dog run away, has it? Yeah, it always hurts when a pet doesn't take to you.", true],

		["<se_def>*: He lives at the top of a high mountain and hardly ever comes out in public.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Not that we'd ever see him all the way out here in the sticks, mind, so it doesn't much matter to us.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What was that!? You've found some monuments with things written about the Godbird Empyrea!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Ha ha hah! Very funny! You can't get me with that one! I've realised now that no one here knows anything about her.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was a fool to believe the rumours in the first place.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Can you believe what's happened!? I gave my love letter to the nun I like, and do you know what she said to it!? \u2018Sorry\u2019!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I did just what the Goddess said and I confessed my feelings, but I didn't expect to get that kind of response!", true],
		["<se_def>*: What do you suppose it is that's so wrong with me anyway? Huh! Stupid Goddess!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Gurgh, don't wake me up! I'm trying to get some sleep now so that I can stay awake tonight.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Tonight's the night! I'm gonna get my hands on a nice black market weapon if it's the last thing I do!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm going back to sleep now then. Goodnight!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Zzzz...phantom weapon...sword of legend...zzzz...", true],
		["<se_low>*: Can you believe that man!? The nerve of him, sleeping in my shop like that! He's stopping me from doing business!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Even though I have no idea what I did wrong, I must have hurt that man very badly for him to write such a threatening letter.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So I went over to him and apologised profusely for whatever it was I'd done.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And, thankfully, he said it was all right and that I was forgiven.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So you see, if people communicate with each other directly, they can come to a common understanding.<page>*: I feel like I've really learnt something from this.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Really!? Marek's left town again? Oh no!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Now I'm going to be worried about falling ill again!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wish he wouldn't just go off like that! He's supposed to be the town doctor, after all!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Those wolves that everyone was always talking about before seem to have gone now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Do you think a brave hero came along and got rid of them for us!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: What!? You fought them off!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Wow! That's amazing! ...Although, it's not very cool to go around boasting about it.", true],
		["<se_high>*: No, I suppose that kind of thing only happens in fairy tales. Ah, the real world's so boring sometimes.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I heard that there's a village somewhere in the world that's full of legends about the Lord of Darkness, Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It must be a very remote place for its people to still be talking about something as loathsome as him.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Marek told me to stay here and rest until he came back.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But my cold's gone now, so how much longer do I have to lie here doing nothing!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I make snowmen every single day... If I don't think of another game soon, people will start to think I'm a one-trick husky!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Hahh...Hahh... My beer belly doesn't seem to have got any smaller yet, but I'd swear my love handles are a bit less of a handful!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Exercise isn't so bad if you've got a goal in mind!", true],

		["<se_def>*: Have you heard the song that poet over there's written?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's a masterpiece. The lyrics are so...so heart-rending!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've finally managed to stay awake so I can come to the weapon shop when it's open, but the owner won't sell anything to me!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe you need some kind of special arrangement before they'll let you buy black market goods.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Rotten luck, though! I came all this way and it looks like I'll leave empty-handed.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I decided I wasn't going to sell any weapons to that bloke over there.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It's payback time for all those nights he got in my way by snoozing in my shop!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Children are always coming down with something or other, and my husband's getting on a bit now as well...", true],
		["<se_high>*: The more I think about it, the more panicky I get!", true],

		["<se_def>*: He brought a big dog back with him as well.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He seemed to be quite attached to it. I wonder where he picked it up from!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Marek's back again. But he's been so unreliable lately, going off all the time.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Maybe I should start studying herbs myself...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Then I'd be able to make my own medicine if I fell ill. Hmm, that's not a bad idea!", true],
		["<se_def>Marek: Have you come to tell me you defeated the evil black dog that killed my mother?", true],
		["<se_def>Marek: ...This is a shame. But I am sure that you will find it soon and avenge my mother's death.", true],
		["<se_def>Marek: ...This is true!? You have really defeated the evil dog?", true],
		["<se_def>Marek: ...Thank you. I am indebted to you once again for your efforts.", true],
		["<se_def>Marek: Ah, yes! There is something I want to give you. It can in no way repay you for all you have done, but it is a small token of my thanks.", true],

		["<se_def>*: What terrible misfortune! But fortunate, of course, that you are now back safe and sound.", true],
		["<se_def>*: My humble shop depends on you and your herbs, just as the rest of the town does.", true],

		["<se_def>*: Are you worried about the sky turning red as well?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I wouldn't let it bother you. I mean, there's nothing we can do about what colour it is. So there's just no sense in losin' sleep over it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I asked Marek to give me some nook grass to sell at my shop, but he said no!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Seems he's still having problems growing enough of it, so we can't put it on sale yet.", true],

		["<se_def>*: Hic! I got carried away and had a bit too much to drink!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I think I've really gone too far this time. The sky looked like it had gone red!", true],

		["<se_high>*: What!? The sky turned red!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Ha hah! How can you say something like that with a straight face!? Bit of a joker, aren't you!?", true],

		["<se_high>*: You're those friends of Marek, aren't you?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Did you come here to see if he's okay after what happened with the sky turning red?", true],

		["<se_low>*: Even when the world's in crisis, he can't take any time off from tending to his herbs. What a job!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Mayor's asked me to do a bit of research into what's goin' on in the world. It doesn't look good.", true],
		["<se_def>*: All the old books talk about is despair and destruction. I wonder what's going to happen to us all.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The sky went red like it was on fire the other day. It looked really pretty!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I don't know why it went like that, but it was cool! I hope it happens again soon!", true],
