		["<se_def>*: And vicious to go with it! I'm tellin' you, there's somethin' wrong with Dominico's head if he thinks that thing's cute!", true],

		["<se_def>*: Like I said, his name's Rydon.<page>*: And remember to pass on my message, if you do manage to find him. Tell him to come home and visit his family once in a while!", true],
		["<se_high>*: D'you want to know what I'm doing? I'm chewing on Mum's recipes!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Grandpa always told me I should sit and chew on things for a while if I didn't understand them. So I'm chewing on these.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Kranbartle family is full of talented masons. Unfortunately, my husband isn't one of them!", true],

		["<se_def>*: Well! You're a bit keen, aren't you!? Drinking's an evening affair. Come back once the sun's set!", true],

		["<se_def>*: This is just between you and me, but that big black dog of Dominico's bit me the other day.", true],
		["<se_def>*: His master came running over to apologise. Or so I thought! What he actually said was: \u2018Don't give Sir Leopold germs!\u2019", true],
		["<se_def>*: He might be a great magician, but that man has the manners of a dog himself!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Dominico's always telling everyone that he's the heir of a great sage or something, but I don't know what he's talking about.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The truth is that no one in town wants anything to do with the stuck-up old fuddy-duddy. But no one would ever say that, of course.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There are more than a handful of people who were disappointed to hear Dominico went unscathed in that burglary the other day.", true],
		["<se_high>*: We all bow and scrape whenever he's around, but inside most people around here detest the man.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If you follow the path outside Dominico's house straight up north, there's a shop they call \u2018Mystery Mart\u2019.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I don't know what they sell, but a fishy-looking man comes and opens it up of a night.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Huh huh. That was a good shop! This town's got some remarkable goods for sale!", true],
		["<se_low>*: They say old grandpa Kranbartle's still buildin' that tower of his all on his own. Rydon, his name is.", true],

		["<se_low>*: You idiot! I told you the legs were wobbly! Now hold the ladder!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I don't know who YOU are, but I imagine you know who I am! You've heard of the Great Magician Dominico, I presume!?", true],

		["<se_low>Dominico: I will permit you to dispense with formalities and simply call me \u2018Master Dominico\u2019.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Now then, that wand-waving sprat... She said something rather ominous about coming back, did she not?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Well even the Great Dominico cannot magic up a barrier stronger than the one I had already erected.<page>Dominico: So despite having thanked you already for helping me before, I shall now bestow you with the honour of running a little errand for me!", true],

		["<se_low>Dominico: Well? No doubt you've changed your mind, and you will now accept the task?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Good. Now then, there has long been a family of stonemasons in this town called the Kranbartles.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: There are two jewels, known as the Kran Spinels, which have been in that family for generations.<page>Dominico: The jewels harbour tremendous magical power.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I've asked them to give me the gemstones before, but the last Kranbartle was a stubborn old fool. He refused to listen to reason!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: So your task is simply to persuade the Kranbartle family to hand over the Kran Spinels.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: However stubborn they are, I'm sure they wouldn't ignore a truly heartfelt plea.<page>Dominico: Anyway, the method you use is up to you. I only care about results!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I will be unable to construct a barrier capable of warding off that pesky wand-waving wench without those jewels, so hurry along!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Oh, you foolishly forgot to ask me! The Kranbartles live in a tiny little place situated just below the fountain in the courtyard.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I need you to get me the Kran Spinels. The Kranbartle family's pair of jewels.", true],

		["<se_def>David: He even offered to let me work here in his house as a servant. Words can't express how grateful I am.", true],
		["<se_def>David: Sometimes he comes across as a bit cold, but he's a genuinely kind person inside.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's you! Aren't you...? Yes, we met in Alexandria. I'm sure of it. You remember me, don't you? Lorenzo, Jessica's fianc\u00e9.", true],
		["<se_def>Lorenzo: I couldn't possibly return home without Jessica, so I have embarked on an impromptu journey.", true],
		["<se_def>Lorenzo: I learn something new every day. People call me a sponge, you know.<page>Lorenzo: Because I soak up all the knowledge I come into contact with. Ah ha hah! At least, I think that's why they call me that...", true],

		["<se_def>Lorenzo: Er, yes! Of course! I'm so sorry!", true],
		["<se_def>Lorenzo: I'm afraid I must get back to work. I've enrolled in an apprenticeship here, you know. We'll have to continue our little chat some other time.", true],

		["<se_high>*: There's a rule here.<page>*: You aren't allowed to sell a statue to anyone from outside town if Dominico hasn't enchanted it and given it a soul using his magic powers.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So everyone in town has to be nice to Dominico.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But I know the truth. It was Dominico's own ancestors who invented that rule in the first place! It's so sneaky, don't you think?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Mum and Dad are all posh when they speak with Mr. Dominico, but at home when he's not there they say really bad things about him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's not fair! They always tell me off if I say anything bad about MY friends.", true],

		["<se_high>*: There are rooms in this mansion that even the staff aren't allowed to go inside.", true],

		["<se_def>*: I thought I'd lose my job because of that witch with the staff, but Master Dominico decided to keep me on because he thinks she might come back!<page>*: Ironic, isn't it?", true],
		["<se_def>*: He'll give me my marching orders if I make another mistake, that's for sure.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Master Dominico's talking about employing more people around the house. I hope there'll be some kitchen hands among the newcomers!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, you're back! And without the Kran Spinels, judging by the expression on your <IF_SOLO>face<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>faces<ENDIF_SOLO>.", true],

		["<se_high>*: My little boy's playing out in the street again today.", true],

		["<se_def>*: Ah, hello! So, did you manage to find my father?", true],
		["<se_def>*: You did? And he didn't look like he'd be coming home any time soon? Ah ha ha! Yes, that'd be my dad! Same as ever!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's been his obsession for almost as long as I can remember to finish off that tower of his before he passes away.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I might not be much of a stonemason myself, but I know enough to recognise that Dad's a real prodigy.", true],
		["<se_def>*: And I know he feels the need to leave his mark on the world. I just wish he'd take better care of himself, that's all.", true],
		["<se_high>*: My father-in-law used to sing the praises of our little girl all the time. He was always saying how quick on the uptake she was.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's the Kranbartle family genius showing through in her if you ask me.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Dominico's in the garden making fun of David again. Poor David! He has to put up with it every single day.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Looks like this man Dominico's got a taste for teasing his employees and making them suffer!", true],
		["<se_def>*: He'll treat me like that if I do anything wrong. I can't afford any slip-ups!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I thought I'd lose my job because of that witch with the staff, but Master Dominico decided to keep me on because he thinks she might come back!<page>*: Ironic, isn't it?", true],

		["<se_def>*: The Master's taken on more guards with barely a moment's notice! I'm run off my feet trying to feed all these extra mouths!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I only came here to buy some weapons. I never thought I'd end up getting a job!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm looking forward to seeing this girl with the stick that everyone's talking about.<page>*: It'll give me a good opportunity to see how sharp my new blade is!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's one hell of a racket coming from upstairs. Has something happened at Dominico's place again?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Dominico can be a bit nasty, but David's at fault too.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I mean, he shouldn't put up with it! A real man would just pack up and leave!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I saw the whole episode right from the start. The dog seemed to be in a foul mood. It was even barking at Dominico.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Then David turned up with the thing's dinner, and Dominico just laid into him! It was completely unjustified! The man's got a screw loose, if you ask me!", true],
		["<se_def>Leopold: Woof! Woof! Grrrrrrr.", true],
		["<se_def>David: Oh, it's you! Ha ha ha! You saw that, did you? How embarrassing!", true],
		["<se_def>David: For some reason the Master's in a bad mood today. He needs someone to take his frustration out on.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I'll have to be careful he doesn't dismiss me. I don't want to leave this job. I like it here. And I'm very fond of the Master.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I can't explain why exactly, but I feel like it's fate that I've ended up working here.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: This leads to my secret library. You will find a book for me in there.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: It's called \u2018The Big Book of Barriers\u2019. It contains a recipe for making a very powerful magical barrier.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: What are you waiting for!? Didn't I tell you to stand guard outside the mansion and stall that wand-waving witch!?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Go! Now! Keep her busy while I finish constructing this barrier, and then I shall take care of her myself!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Hm? You're injured? You really are taking up far too much of my time! Fiery foo and bubbling goo... There!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Go! Now! Keep her busy while I finish constructing this barrier, and then I shall take care of her myself!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I, I heard shouting from outside, and then the guards all went running out. What's going on!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: No! Spare me! Please!", true],
		["<se_high>*: That young witch sent all the guards flying! Just with a little flick of her stick, you know!", true],
		["<se_high>*: She's using black magic, I tell you. Don't waste your time trying to stop her. I should just hand Dominico over to her, if I were you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Uuurgh... We couldn't do anything to stop her... Blast!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You wouldn't have thought a woman'd be up to much, would you? But that one means business! She's gotta be some kind of demon!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Th-There's nothing more we can do! Do you think this is it for the town!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: You could sound a little more upset about it!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Phew! Well, that's a relief!<page>*: ...Hang on a minute! What's there to be relieved about!? Just because you SAY the town'll be all right, it doesn't mean it WILL!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I must say I was rather surprised. That girl can wield a fair amount of magic with that stick of 'ers<endash> ...hers.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Without wishing to be rude, I'm fairly sure she'll have the upper hand over Dominico when it comes to magic.", true],
		["<se_def>*: If Dominico gets killed, we'll have no one to enchant the statues with souls. Then what'll happen, eh!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Actually... Come to think of it, what WOULD happen?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I thought guards were supposed to be good at fighting! What a bunch of losers!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Urrgh! No...", true],
		["<se_def>*: All right! That's it! Yeah!", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's all Dominico's fault! If he wasn't here, the town wouldn't have got in this mess in the first place!", true],
		["<se_high>*: What are you doing just standing here talking!? Go and help David! Or are you a coward!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: I don't know! The youth of today! If I were a couple of years younger, I could've got rid of that little girl with a stern word and a firm stare!<page>*: There's only one of her, for crying out loud!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Oh! I don't believe it! I wanted a front-row view of the action when that woman came back for a fight. I'd been waiting ages!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I only nipped off to get a bite to eat. I wasn't gone for more than a few minutes. But she came just when I wasn't there to see!", true],
		["<se_high>*: That's the second time we've had to weather such a storm.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Dear Goddess, have you abandoned the good people of Arcadia?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Blast it all! I'm too late! I can't see! I can't see a thing from here!", true],
		["<se_low>*: KWA-HUURGH-URGH-URGH!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I suppose this marks the end of the peace we've enjoyed here for so long. How sad.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Even at times like these, the weapon and armour shops are still doing business!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I think the innkeeper's shut up shop, but you're Master Dominico's <IF_SOLO>guard<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>guards<ENDIF_SOLO>, aren't you?", true],
		["<se_high>*: Then he'll see to it that you're in good health. He'll heal you.", true],
		["<se_def>Lorenzo: What on earth is going on!? There's an awful din coming from the mansion.", true],
		["<se_def>Lorenzo: Ah-ha! This is it! At last! Now the Master's not here, this is my chance!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I can't get a very good view, but I think there's a woman perched on top of that hideous statue outside Dominico's mansion.", true],
		["<se_low>*: And she looks like a bit of a cracker! Oh, I'm forgetting myself! This is no time for that kind of chat!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I've got a deadline to meet with this statue! I wish they'd keep the noise down outside!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Why am I stuck in here!? Everyone else is having fun outside! I can hear them!<page>*: Mum and Dad said I had to stay at home while they were out. It's not fair!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Listen to all the noise upstairs! Sounds like that troublemaker's back again.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But there'll be no trouble here! I won't let anyone hurt my family!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Mum! What's going to happen to us!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's no need to worry, dear. We Kranbartles are special. Our ancestors will protect us.", true],
		["<se_high>*: So you just relax and go to sleep now.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even my wife went running off to see what all the fuss was about outside. I just hope nobody's been hurt.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It wouldn't be funny if the weapon shop was shut just when you really needed a weapon, would it!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: But if you are hopin' to do a bit of shoppin', you'll have to go 'round and come in through the front door!", true],
		["<se_low>*: They say the person attacking the town's a woman! On her own!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It's a sorry state of affairs when a little girl can send a whole town full of adults into such an uproar!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Blast! I can't...", true],
		["<se_def>*: But...how could a girl...? I mean, how could I be beaten by...?", true],
		["<se_def>Leopold: Woof, woof, woof! Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof!", true],
		["<se_def>David: Thank the Goddess you're back again!", true],
		["<se_def>David: I've just about managed to hold her off so far, but I can't keep this up on my own!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: New fires seem to be springing up before we've managed to extinguish the old ones.<page>King Trode: Just look at me! I'm still afflicted with this intolerable curse!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Still, I suppose now is hardly the time for a grumble. We must hurry, <hero>!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I saw Dominico fighting that witch with my own eyes. Whatever you say about the man, he's certainly a very powerful magician.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I know he's got his faults in other areas, but you can't help being impressed by his magic.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Is that...thing, a friend of yours? It looks like a monster to me! I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to stay away from my inn!", true],
		["<se_low>*: It seems Leopold's gone missing. All the men are out looking for him.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If he was really attached to his master, he'd come back of his own accord, of course!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Sir Leopoooold! Where aaaare you!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: The man's a real slave-driver! My wounds haven't healed properly yet, but he's still ordering me to go and look for his stupid dog!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I just want to find it, get my pay, and go back to working at the checkpoint as soon as possible!", true],
		["<se_low>*: That good-for-nothing apprentice of mine has done a runner!<page>*: He must have slipped off in all the excitement. What a lazy bleeding clothes-horse!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Y-You've got to help David!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I've been waiting here for ages since the last fight I missed.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But that kind of thing doesn't exactly happen all the time, does it? I can't believe I missed the action before!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Dad said the lady who attacked Dominico was really beautiful.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wish I'd seen her!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Master Dominico's become thoroughly depressed since Leopold ran away.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It must have been a terrible shock for him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: If you're looking for him, he'll be dining about now, I should think.", true],
		["<se_def>David: There you are!", true],
		["<se_def>David: Thank you so much! I'll never forget how you saved my life.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I just can't work out why she went for me, though. It doesn't make any sense.", true],
		["<se_def>David: She said I was an heir of a great sage, but she's got it wrong. I'm just an ordinary man.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I'm nothing more than a servant. Master Dominico is the noble one. And I'll always serve him to the very best of my ability.", true],
		["<se_def>David: Anyway, there's no time to stand around chatting! I've got to go and look for Sir Leopold.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I wonder where he went. He can be a bit scary, but he's a very intelligent animal.", true],
		["<se_def>David: Let me know if you spot him anywhere.", true],
		["<se_def>David: I'm always making a mess of things, so this time I really want to help the Master. I owe it to him to do everything I can to find Sir Leopold.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was beaten twice by the same girl, so now I've been put on dog-hunting duty! Hardly surprising. My days as a guard are over!", true],
		["<se_def>*: When that girl brandished that stick she had, it was as if my whole body had been drained of energy.", true],
		["<se_def>*: There was no way I could have defeated her with a sword alone. No, I've learnt a valuable lesson!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There's been all kinds of trouble here in town lately. It's a shame. The place used to be nice and quiet before.", true],
		["<se_low>*: That woman who was here brandishing her wand had a fine figure on her! You must have noticed. I mean, you could hardly miss it!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Seeing her has given me one or two ideas. A real gush of inspiration! I feel something special coming on, I do!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Dominico is usually very cold with people, but he was surprisingly friendly to you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What? You didn't think so? Oh, that's just because you don't know what he's usually like!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Under normal circumstances, he'd never have let that witch go, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Well, we've seen it all here recently, haven't we!? But thank the Goddess no one lost their life.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Leopold normally stands behind Dominico and barks his head off at people. But he wasn't so bold when that witch turned up, was he!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: And now he's run off somewhere. He must've been terrified! Serves the pesky mutt right!", true],
		["<se_def>*: After all that commotion, everything turned out all right in the end. Thank goodness for that!", true],
		["<se_def>*: And I don't suppose Dad knows anything about it!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Everyone who knows anything about masonry says the same thing:", true],
		["<se_high>*: Rydon Kranbartle is a man of unparalleled genius. He's already outstripped all of the great Kranbartles who've gone before him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But my poor father-in-law just can't see it! I suppose that's the trouble with geniuses. Sometimes the simplest things pass them by.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I LOVE Grandad's statue! It's so BOING, and really BOOM! And kind of BAM as well!", true],
		["<se_def>*: In all the commotion, everyone just left without paying for their drinks!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm properly in the red now! I lost a fortune! Dear oh dear...", true],
		["<se_high>*: Masonry is the art of creating the Goddess's image in rock. All the people of Arcadia are Her obedient servants.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Not a single life was lost in either of the disturbances we've had of late.<page>*: More proof, if any were needed, that the town is under the Goddess's divine protection.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Normally the Master eats enough for three, but he's not had a single bite today.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And he doesn't look very well for it. I think fighting off that woman before really took it out of him.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Listen to what I heard today! There's talk that Master Dominico isn't the heir of the great sage at all. They're saying it's actually David!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I ask you! What a load of rubbish! Don't you go believing it! I really don't know who starts all this gossip sometimes!", true],
		["<se_high>*: The thunder was so loud, I couldn't hear very well...", true],
		["<se_high>*: But I think that witch said Dominico wasn't the heir of the great sage he's always on about, and that it was really David!", true],
		["<se_high>*: If you ask me, neither of them look like anything special. But I'm starting to wonder if any of this great sage stuff is true.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I hear that dog of Dominico's has run off.", true],
		["<se_def>*: You should be careful, or you might end up being bitten like I was.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently the apprentice in the workshop just above us here ran off because the work was too hard!", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm not surprised really. Only a handful of people stick out the training and stay here in Arcadia, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: David's in danger! Whoever picks up the sceptre will fall under Rhapthorne's control!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We have to find it! We have to save David!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Come on, <hero>! We must find the sceptre before it's too late!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Ah, welcome to The Still Chisel, how ma<endash> Wha!? Er, I hope you don't mind me asking, but...", true],
		["<se_low>*: Is that...thing, a friend of yours? It looks like a monster to me! I'm sorry, but I'll have to ask you to stay away from my inn!", true],
		["The sound of running water and a woman humming can be heard from within the room. But the door is locked from the inside.", true],
		["<se_high>*: ...Who's there!?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I, I don't know who you are, but if you open that door, you'll get a statue on yer 'ead! I mean, on your head!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Oh, it's you. I've not been feeling well ever since seeing that little witch off, you know.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: It's not a physical matter. I've just got an uneasiness that I can't seem to shake.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: It's hard to put it into words, but I'm gripped by the feeling that I've made a most almighty blunder.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: But the Great Dominico does not suffer from indecision and regret!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: ...I'm in no mood to talk now. Leave me! Come back and see me later if you need something.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I told you already! I'm in no mood to talk now! Leave!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I didn't know what I was doing, but I've done a terrible thing.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Please, <leader>. Destroy Leopold for me, and help me put right my wrongs.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I heard Leopold left Arcadia to the north. Be careful as you go.", true],
		["<se_def>*: We put David in a coffin full of flowers and sent him out to sea.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's not easy saying goodbye to someone you've worked with.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Master Dominico seems to have got his health back, but he's still very gloomy.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I suppose it's no surprise, what with everything that's happened.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was more than a little surprised, I don't mind telling you! David WAS the real heir of the great sage, not Master Dominico at all!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I suppose that means the Master's life isn't in danger any more, but I don't imagine that's much comfort to the man now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: David's loyalty to his master was very touching. He was the most faithful man I've ever met.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ahhh! She's back!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Oh, no. That's right. We don't have to worry about you attacking us any more, do we?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even so, the sight of your face is enough to start me shaking now. I can't help it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I made such a mess of everything before, I was sure I was going to get the sack.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But Master Dominico must have mellowed a bit.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I saw it. I saw Leopold attacking David.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He suddenly jumped down from the roof and stabbed a wooden stick into David's back.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I came to see David every day...but I never thought I'd be there to see his last moments... It's just too sad...", true],
		["<se_low>*: It's terribly sad to see someone younger than yourself pass away.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Dominico paid me a great wage.", true],
		["<se_def>*: He might not be the friendliest man around, but at least he's generous! He's all right by me!", true],
		["<se_high>*: David was quite popular among the young women in town, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He was handsome and loyal. Two things that make a man very attractive to a young lady!", true],
		["<se_def>*: If you head north out of Arcadia, and keep going on and on, long past old Rydon's tower, you'll come to a short tunnel.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Most of the people here don't go there much, mind. It's mighty cold on the other side, see.", true],
		["<se_def>*: A letter just arrived from Dad. By carrier pigeon!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently he's coming home soon. That's almost unheard of, I can tell you. I wonder what's happened.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe it's something to do with being perched up here together on this stone arch, but there's a real family atmosphere in Arcadia.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So you can understand why everyone's taking the loss of poor David so much to heart.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I can't believe David's gone! ...I'll let you in on a little secret. I really liked David. I never told him, though.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Masonry is the art of creating the Goddess's image in rock. All the people of Arcadia are Her obedient servants.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And as such, the Goddess sends things to try us. We must have faith, and we will overcome these hardships.", true],
		["<se_high>*: People say the medicinal herbs they sell in Orkutsk up north really work. Apparently, it's because they're grown in such a cold climate.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'd like to sell them here too, but it's such a long way to Orkutsk.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I knew it! That Leopold is a savage beast! What kind of dog would kill the very person who looks after it!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It bit me once, you know. Looking back now, I suppose I got off lightly!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I just exchanged a few words with Dominico for the first time in a while.<page>*: I don't know if it's because he's so low at the moment, but it looked like he'd aged ten years or more.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Mind you, if being down makes him a bit more laid-back, things would certainly be easier for everyone 'round here.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Someone told me once about these people who live in a secluded place in the mountains, completely cut off from the rest of the world.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It sounds like the kind of place where wizards would live, don't you think?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ahhh! She's back!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Oh, no. That's right. We don't have to worry about you attacking us any more, do we?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even so, the sight of your face is enough to start me shaking now. I can't help it.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, it's you! Thanks for your help protecting Master Dominico.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's been pretty peaceful around here since then. It's in danger of getting a bit boring actually!", true],
		["<se_low>*: I've been looking out to sea like this ever since I was a young girl.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Far, far across the ocean, there's a small island where a man I know lives. It was a long time ago now, but we were in love once, you see.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even if I went back to the checkpoint, there probably wouldn't be any work. So I've decided to stay here and work for Dominico.", true],
		["<se_def>*: With my salary I could drink as much as I wanted every day and still have some left over. Yup, this place suits me down to the ground!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Lorenzo ran off while everyone was distracted with that witch. That apprentice was the biggest waste of space I've ever seen!", true],
		["<se_def>*: There hasn't been any kind of disturbance here for a while now. The town's back to its peaceful ways. Just right for masonry work.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I hear old Rydon's coming back to town. How many years has it been, I wonder? I'll have to go and have a chat with him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Grandpa Rydon invited me to his house!", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's the best! There's nothing like home cooking! (Slurp!)", true],
		["<se_def>*: My father was so strict with me when I was a lad, but he's all sweetness and light with his granddaughter!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I just don't understand him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Wahey! Grandpa's back! Grandpa's back!", true],
		["<se_low>Rydon: Ah, you're <IF_SOLO>one of the ones<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>the ones<ENDIF_SOLO> who climbed my tower, aren't you?", true],
		["<se_low>Rydon: I still want to build it higher, but there's a problem. That's why I've come back here, you see.", true],
		["<se_low>Rydon: It's my granddaughter. She's just too adorable. It's interrupting my work.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's an old legend in the Kranbartle family. One of our ancestors, Alexander, sculpted the statue of the Goddess on the Holy Isle of Neos.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And do you know what!? They say that he was actually looking at the Goddess with his own eyes as he carved the stone.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently, the Goddess inspired courage in everyone She met. And they say She could fly, too! I'd love to know more about Her.", true],
		["<se_high>*: We hardly see Dominico at all since that scary woman attacked the town.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He must be getting even fatter, being stuck inside every day. I hope he hasn't got wedged in a doorway or something!", true],
		["<se_def>*: This is Master Dominico's residence. Unless you've got some business here, I must ask you to<endash> Oh! It's you!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Master's upstairs. You should go and tell him you're here.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, good! You're back. Have you...disposed of Leopold for me?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: You chased him up north but then he flew away, you say!?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I've never heard of a flying dog before!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: ...Nevertheless, you do appear to be telling the truth. I suppose there's nothing you could have done.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: But my feelings haven't changed! Leopold must be destroyed! I know I can rely on you.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, yes. There's something I've been meaning to tell you.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: When David first arrived here, he told me something about the place he'd been before.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: It seems he'd been living in an isolated valley somewhere.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I don't know the actual location, but he did say something about a place where all manner of beings lived together in harmony.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I doubt that such information will be any use to you on its own, but I thought it was only right to tell you, for David's sake.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Anyway, good luck finding Leopold.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I heard that the Baccarat casino was closed down for a while. I wonder if it's open again now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: If I could spare a few days, I was thinking I might go and see what's what.", true],
		["<se_low>*: We're blessed with a bench in town that has a wonderful view across the ocean. It's been a second home to me over the years.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Yes, the man I love is out there somewhere, on a little island far, far across the sea.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It must be more than six months now since David came to the house.", true],
		["<se_high>*: My first impressions were of a grubby little traveller, but he's actually very attentive and good-natured. He's a nice lad, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I really can't see why Dominico has such a problem with him. And why on earth would you employ someone you dislike so much anyway!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Some stonemasons toss their failed works into the ocean, but I like to keep mine.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I find it helps me to improve what I'm doing if I have some failures to look at while I'm working.<page>*: I suppose it's rather like a warning not to make the same mistake twice.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Kranbartle family is full of talented masons. Unfortunately, my husband isn't one of them!", true],
		["<se_high>*: It upset him quite a lot when he was younger, but he's got over it now and manages to enjoy the other things in his life.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Nobody breaks through the checkpoint while I'm on duty!<page>*: I'll teach that girl a lesson! Although...I seem to have lost her for the time being.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But I can't go back now. It'd be too annoying, having come all this way. I may as well have a look at the sights while I'm here.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I was given instructions by a certain wealthy gentleman to come here and purchase a statue of a woman on his behalf.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But there are so many workshops in this place, I don't know where to start!", true],
		["<se_low>*: That good-for-nothing apprentice of mine has done a runner!<page>*: He must have slipped off in all the excitement. What a lazy bleeding clothes-horse!", true],
		["<se_high>*: My father-in-law used to sing the praises of our little girl all the time. He was always saying how quick on the uptake she was.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's the Kranbartle family genius showing through in her if you ask me.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently there's a famous magician here by the name of Dominico who's recruiting guards to protect his mansion.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I heard the pay was pretty good, so I thought I may as well apply.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Well, we've seen it all here recently, haven't we!? But thank the Goddess no one lost their life.", true],
		["<se_def>*: In all the commotion, everyone just left without paying for their drinks!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I'm properly in the red now! I lost a fortune! Dear oh dear...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Dominico is usually very cold with people, but he was surprisingly friendly to you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: What? You didn't think so? Oh, that's just because you don't know what he's usually like!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Under normal circumstances, he'd never have let that witch go, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Everyone who knows anything about masonry says the same thing:", true],
		["<se_high>*: Rydon Kranbartle is a man of unparalleled genius. He's already outstripped all of the great Kranbartles who've gone before him.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But my poor father-in-law just can't see it! I suppose that's the trouble with geniuses. Sometimes the simplest things pass them by.", true],
		["<se_high>*: David was quite popular among the young women in town, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: He was handsome and loyal. Two things that make a man very attractive to a young lady!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Maybe it's something to do with being perched up here together on this stone arch, but there's a real family atmosphere in Arcadia.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So you can understand why everyone's taking the loss of poor David so much to heart.", true],
		["<se_high>*: David's loyalty to his master was very touching. He was the most faithful man I've ever met.", true],
		["<se_high>*: There's an old legend in the Kranbartle family. One of our ancestors, Alexander, sculpted the statue of the Goddess on the Holy Isle of Neos.", true],
		["<se_high>*: And do you know what!? They say that he was actually looking at the Goddess with his own eyes as he carved the stone.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Apparently, the Goddess inspired courage in everyone She met. And they say She could fly, too! I'd love to know more about Her.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Lorenzo ran off while everyone was distracted with that witch. That apprentice was the biggest waste of space I've ever seen!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Back again, are we!? How pathetically misguided you are!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Fine. This time I'll make sure you can never get in my way again!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, you're back at last, <leader>! I've been waiting for you.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: ...I presume that expression on your face means you have finally defeated Leopold?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Don't worry, I'm not going to get upset with you! The dog you destroyed was no longer the same creature as my wonderful Leopold.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: It's over, then. I can finally grieve for my lost friends.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I'm sorry for having caused you so much trouble.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Now I've decided to turn over a new leaf.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: One of my servants told me it was David's wish that the townspeople and I could live together happily.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: So I've made up my mind to smooth things over a little. To see if I can't make David's wish come true.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I suppose <IF_SOLO>you'll<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>you and your friends will<ENDIF_SOLO> be continuing with your travels, will you, <leader>? I hope you'll come and visit Arcadia again some time.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Oh, it's <IF_SOLO>you<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>you lot<ENDIF_SOLO>. If you're looking for Master Dominico, he's inside.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ever since the sky turned red the other day, he's been in there frantically looking things up in his books.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Ahhh! She's back!", true],
		["<se_def>*: ...Oh, no. That's right. We don't have to worry about you attacking us any more, do we?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Even so, the sight of your face is enough to start me shaking now. I can't help it.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I saw that huge rock flying in the sky.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I wonder if Dominico knows anything about it.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I dunno, first a witch attacks the town, and now the sky's turned red! You never know what's gonna happen next, do ya!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: We had a bit of peace and quiet for a while, but now there's another calamity!<page>*: I'm going to have to find somewhere quieter or I'll never get any work done.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Seeing that rather fine-looking woman before gave me inspiration all right! But I don't know...", true],
		["<se_low>*: Somehow I just don't seem to be able to make a decent statue. I haven't got the talent of a gifted stonemason.", true],
		["<se_def>*: People are sayin' the monsters outside town have got tougher. Ya can't even go out for a walk these days!", true],
		["<se_def>*: People are talking about nothing but the sky turning red. What's the big deal, eh?", true],
		["<se_def>*: I mean, when I was a lad, a red sky at night was someone-or-other's delight.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I had a dream about the sister I left behind in Pickham.", true],
		["<se_high>*: She was gibbering on about something or other. I hope she's all right.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, so I was right! I thought you'd be paying me visit.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: I can feel it. A terrible evil, worse than the one I felt before the sky turned red.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Sealing that evil away is an impossibility now! Destroying it is the only option!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Good luck, <leader>! The duty once fulfilled by the great sages now rests on your shoulders!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Good luck, <leader>! The duty once fulfilled by the great sages now rests on your shoulders!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Some people are saying that the sky turning red is an omen signalling the end of the world.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It's not that I don't believe it, it's just that I don't really know how to react to news like that!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Apparently the Goddess statue on the Holy Isle of Neos has been destroyed.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It saddens me to think I'll never see that beautiful work of art again.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I've lived in Arcadia all my life. I used to play with Dominico when we were children, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Looking back now, I sometimes wonder if all our teasing hasn't had something to do with the way he's turned out.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Have you heard? They say the Baccarat casino's open again now.", true],
		["<se_low>*: I think I might go and try my luck if I can spare the time.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Things aren't good. Ever since the sky went red, no one's been comin' to town.", true],
		["<se_low>*: People say it's the end of the world. Maybe they're right!", true],
		["<se_low>*: Someone told me once about these people who live in a secluded place in the mountains, completely cut off from the rest of the world.", true],
		["<se_low>*: It sounds like the kind of place where wizards would live, don't you think?", true],
		["<se_high>*: I love reading horoscopes. There was something about a red sky in one I read the other day.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It said that if the sky turns red, you can expect to be lucky in love three days later! The best chance of your life, it said!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Someone help! Come quickly! I-It's David!", true],
		["<se_high>*: W-What was that!? I heard screaming! What's happened!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: Heaven forbid! Not more trouble!", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ooooh! My head! And I'm shaking all over. What's wrong with me?", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ooooh!", true],
		["<voice_0x01001273><se_high>*: P-Please! You must help David!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: The sceptre went missin' about the time that Dominico bloke was up to 'is tricks.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Cor, we'll be in a right fix if it's fallen into the sea or somefin'!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I realise we had no choice, but fighting a lady goes against everything I believe in.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Then again, I've never had a thing for aggressive women.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Ah, you're back! ...And without the Kran Spinels judging by the expression on your <IF_SOLO>face<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>faces<ENDIF_SOLO>.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: There's no time for this! We don't know when that vexing witch is going to show herself again.", true],
		["<se_low>Dominico: Now I'll tell you again in case you've forgotten. The Kranbartle household is just below the fountain in the courtyard. So be off with you!", true]
