		["<se_high>*: Truth be told, I'm glad to see you. Looking back, I think isolating ourselves was the wrong path to take.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Just look at us now. If you ask me, our fate was sealed the moment we made the decision to cut our ties with humans.", true],
		["<se_high>*: All of us, young and old, are slowly losing our life force, our very will to live.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Once, my father walked tall and proud. Now look at him. He's so weak, he can no longer stand.", true],
		["<se_high>*: What have we done to deserve this? And who could have foreseen the tragedy that would befall our Lord?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It has been many years since I last saw a human. And then only a dead one...", true],
		["<se_def>*: Did you happen to see a gravestone on your way here? That is where his body was found.", true],
		["<se_def>*: That was some twenty years ago. He was a young man, and he appeared to be royalty of some kind.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'm sorry, but the law of the Sanctuary forbids me from doing business with humans.", true],
		["<se_high>*: With special permission from the Council of Elders, it would be possible... But for now I cannot, and I must ask you to leave.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Although we did not participate in the battle against the Lord of Darkness long ago, we are perfectly aware of how powerful Rhapthorne is.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You are but humans, yet still you choose to face him. It is most impressive.", true],
		["<se_low>*: No matter how one looks at it, it is only natural for us Dragovians to exist in both human and dragon form.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Our Lord's decision to abandon his human form against all reason is at the root of the tragedy that has befallen us.", true],

		["<se_low>*: That is, by defeating him in battle. When he falls, he will return to his human form...and to his senses, one would hope.", true],
		["<se_low>*: As such, we convened a discussion to select a brave warrior from among our race, to fight the Lord of the Dragovians in single combat.", true],
		["<se_low>*: However, we reached the inevitable conclusion that in our present state, there are none among us strong enough to survive such a confrontation.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Beyond this point lies the path to the Heavenly Dais.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't care if you're guests of Chen Mui. None may pass without the express authorisation of the Council of Elders!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Normally, any human that dared set foot in the Dragovian Sanctuary would be driven out at once.", true],
		["<se_def>*: But now we are too weak to think of such things. The end of the race of Dragovians draws near...", true],
		["<se_def>*: I was sure you would be driven from our Sanctuary. Whatever did you tell the Elders to convince them to let you stay?", true],
		["<se_def>*: What!? You're going to face our Lord in combat!?", true],
		["<se_def>*: The Elders are allowing humans to challenge the Lord of the Dragovians? What madness is this?", true],
		["<se_high>*: The Elders informed me of your intention to face the Lord of the Dragovians. My humble shop is at your service.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I must admit to being nervous. This is the first time I have done business with those of the human race.", true],
		["<se_high>*: As you can see, I carry a variety of items that may only be purchased here in the Dragovian Sanctuary.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Even now it is hard for me to believe that any human is strong enough to face the Lord of Darkness.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Then again, if you aren't strong enough to defeat Rhapthorne, you will find defeating the Lord of the Dragovians an utter impossibility.", true],

		["<se_low>*: I apologise that we can do no more to help you in your endeavour, given our current state.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So you have agreed to face our Lord in battle, in an attempt to bring him back to his senses.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Considering the gravity of the crisis facing the Dragovians, I agree there was no other choice.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Forgive me if I tell you I don't have high hopes for your success. But I wish you luck just the same.", true],

		["<se_def>*: It was wrong of me to treat you so coldly before. I... I'm sorry.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I never would have imagined that people of another race should risk their lives for us.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's an incredible thing. I underestimated you humans.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Do you humans really think anyone believes you stand a chance against our Lord?", true],
		["<se_low>*: With the crisis facing our people, the Elders had no choice but to accept your offer of help.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You're <IF_SOLO>a mere human<ELSE_NOT_SOLO>mere humans<ENDIF_SOLO>! What makes you think you can defeat the Lord of the Dragovians!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: Our Lord has been absorbing our life force for some time. There's simply no estimating how powerful he has become.", true],
		["<se_low>*: By now, he could well have grown stronger than Rhapthorne, I fear.", true],
		["<se_low>*: We have placed an impossible burden on your shoulders, <leader>.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The grave of Miss Xia is located on a side-path along the way to the Heavenly Dais.", true],

		["<se_def>*: Just when did humans grow so strong!? It's nothing short of a miracle!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Your modesty does you great credit, but my sudden recovery is proof enough of your astonishing victory!", true],
		["<se_def>*: Just when did humans grow so strong!? It's nothing short of a miracle!", true],
		["<se_high>*: You are a mix of the human and Dragovian races, <hero>. And you saved us. I can only see it as fate.", true],
		["<se_high>*: You have given us Dragovians much to think about. I suspect we will have no choice but to reconsider our attitude towards the human race.", true],
		["<se_high>*: My father is no longer bedridden. I have you to thank for that!", true],
		["<se_high>*: Even so, he's as hard-headed as ever. Please try not to take the things he says too seriously.", true],
		["<se_def>*: So the Dragovian race was saved by humans.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I must offer you something in thanks, then. We Dragovians know when to show our gratitude.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Allow me to teach you how to make a timbrel of tension.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It is a treasure among treasures for any adventurer. Use it in battle to instantly raise the tension of your entire party by one level.", true],
		["<se_def>*: To make it, you need to combine a hoop of bright sunlight with a magic beast hide and something you humans call a \u2018tough guy tattoo\u2019.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Thank you for saving the Dragovian Sanctuary.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Let me teach you how to make a legendary Dragovian king sword. It's the least I can do to show my gratitude.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The weapon is said to be created by combining a traditional Dragovian sword with a liquid metal sword.", true],
		["<se_high>*: The result is said to be a sword so exquisitely powerful that it is absolutely beyond comparison.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You have defeated the Lord of the Dragovians. I am in awe of your strength and skill as warriors.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Now I agree that you've grown powerful enough to face the Lord of Darkness, Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_low>*: And I believe that the source of your strength, <hero>, is the fact that both human and Dragovian blood surge through your veins.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Though it turned out to be a grave mistake, the Lord of the Dragovians' decision to abandon his human form was not taken lightly.", true],
		["<se_low>*: In fact, it took the tragedy of Chen Mui and his daughter Xia to convince our Lord that something must be done.<page>*: He was determined, you see, that our race should never again suffer such terrible woe.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Yet, had the tragedy never occurred, we never would have had our fateful meeting with you.", true],
		["<se_low>*: You taught us the folly of isolating ourselves simply for the purpose of avoiding sadness and pain, <hero>.", true],
		["<se_low>*: The spell placed upon you to seal away your memories, <hero>, is actually a form of curse.", true],
		["<se_low>*: In fact, it is said that those who suffer from its effects become highly resistant to curses themselves.", true],
		["<se_low>*: Have you ever been unaffected while those around you were stricken by curses?<page>*: That is a testament to its ability to protect as well as make you forget!", true],
		["<se_high>*: In the past, many called Miss Xia wicked for falling in love with a human. But I can't imagine anyone saying that now.", true],
		["<se_high>*: That's another part of your legacy, <hero>. I don't know how to thank you.", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's incredible enough when someone decides to take a Dragovian Trial, but it's all the more incredible that you're a party of humans!", true],
		["<se_def>*: I want you to know I have a lot of respect for what you're doing. Good luck!", true],
		["<se_def>*: The room you're staying in once belonged to Chen Mui's only daughter, Xia.", true],
		["<se_def>*: She was a curious and adventurous girl. One day, she decided to go and see the world of humans for herself.", true],
		["<se_def>*: When Chen Mui noticed she was missing, he immediately set off to find her and bring her home.<page>*: But by the time he located his daughter, she had already fallen in love with a human.", true],
		["<se_def>*: His name was Eltrio. And he was a prince in the world of humans.", true],
		["<se_def>*: I don't remember the name of his kingdom. But I do recall it having a certain tradition.<page>*: The men there gave a ring with a special jewel set in it to their betrothed.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Miss Xia returned to the Dragovian Sanctuary with just such a ring on her finger.", true],
		["<se_def>*: Hm? What became of that ring, you ask?", true],
		["<se_def>*: It's being kept safe and sound, I can assure you. It's Chen Mui's most precious keepsake of his beloved daughter.", true],
		["<se_high>*: On the path to the Dragovian Sanctuary lies an old grave. It belongs to Eltrio, the human who promised his heart to Miss Xia.", true],
		["<se_high>*: It appears that he attempted to follow his beloved from the world of humans all the way to the Dragovian Sanctuary.", true],
		["<se_high>*: But the road here is long and fraught with perils. He died just before reaching the end of his journey.", true],
		["<se_high>*: I'd never seen Miss Xia so sad as the day she heard the news. She passed away not long after.", true],
		["<se_high>*: Even now, Master Chen Mui deeply regrets his decision to split their relationship asunder.", true],
		["<se_low>*: What? You've passed all of the Dragovian Trials?", true],
		["<se_low>*: If that's the case, you have truly earnt a place in the annals of valour!", true],
		["<se_low>*: You really should be proud of yourselves. This momentous achievement must have taken no small amount of effort.", true],
		["<se_low>*: So you have passed a Dragovian Trial! Well done!", true],
		["<se_low>*: But more Trials lie ahead, and they will demand even more training and endurance. Good luck.", true],
		["<se_low>*: What!? The Lord of the Dragovians is allowing you to undertake a Dragovian Trial!?", true],
		["<se_low>*: ...But I shouldn't be surprised, given who I'm speaking to!", true],
		["<se_low>*: If you best the Lord of the Dragovians in a Trial, he will bestow upon you a prize commensurate with your skill.", true],
		["<se_low>*: That said, in the long history of our race, none have ever successfully bested our Lord in battle.", true],
		["<se_low>*: But you are a different matter. Perhaps that is why our Lord has agreed to let you challenge him.", true],
