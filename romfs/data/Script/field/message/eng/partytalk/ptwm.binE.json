		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Shut up! How dare you insult my fianc\u00e9e!?\nWhat would a mere commoner like you know of beauty!? You will apologise at once!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You could probably make quite a nice ring out of an Argon heart.\n...Or would that be a bit of a waste?", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Well, aren't you sharp? Yes, when the initiation ceremony is over, the Argon heart will be fashioned into a wedding ring for my bride.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Part of the purpose of the initiation is to acquire a stone to bequeath to one's future spouse.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So. Back to Argonia, right?\nAnd then we can bid adieu to the Prince.", true],
		["<se_def>Prince Charmles: Hmph! You're fortunate that I'm in such a good mood. Normally I wouldn't let such base sarcasm go unpunished!", true],

		["<se_low>King Trode: Splendid, splendid!\nWe've acquired the magic mirror as planned!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: We've had to go to such lengths, everything's spinning in my head like a kaleidoscope.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: It certainly hasn't been easy, but at least we have the magic mirror now, as promised.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Right, Dhoulmagus!\nYou're about to get wot's comin' to ya!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Huuurgh! Huuurgh! Huuurgh!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Since we 'ad a bit of a break from chasin' 'im, I weren't feelin' so much anger an' that towards Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: So I just needed to charge meself up a bit.\nY'know, get the ol' blood pumpin' again.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We have the magic mirror.\nThat means we're one step closer to Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Still, it doesn't feel that way.\nI just won't be able to relax until we find him.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Wait! Remember the scholar at the castle?\nHe must have been talking about that old man!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You know!\nThe one from the mystical spring!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Now that we've parted company with Prince Charmless...<page>Angelo: ...perhaps I dare venture to ask the father of the bride what he thinks about his future son-in-law?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Hmph!\nIt's none of your business!\nAnd well you should know it!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: There's no need to ask King Trode what he thinks.\nThe scowl on his face speaks volumes.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I dunno. I can't read 'im meself.\nGrandad always looks sour.\nYa never know wot 'e's thinkin'.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Stop pooh-poohing me, and get a move on!\nHave you forgotten we're in the middle of a very important voyage!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What do we do now?\nAre we going straight to the Dark Ruins to try and break down the aura with the magic mirror?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All right.\nIf that's what you've decided, I suppose we'd better get going.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But I can't help worrying about what that scholar said back in Argonia.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So you're worried about what that scholar told us, too? About there being no magic left in the mirror, I mean.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Me too. I get the impression the mirror isn't going to break through the dark aura like we hoped. Nothing's ever that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Well at least the mirror we procured from Argonia wasn't a cheap imitation!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: But it seems the process of turning it back into the sun mirror is going to be very bothersome indeed.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: So we done all that to get our 'ands on a mirror that don't do nuffin' but let me see 'ow cheesed-off I look!?<page>Yangus: It's just a bloomin' dud!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If only there were two magic mirrors in Argonia, we could take our one back and exchange it for a working model.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If you ask me, I think we've been cheated!\nWhat if there really are two mirrors, and they gave us the broken one on purpose?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We should go back and demand a refund!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I ain't too good at rememb'rin' stuff, but I thought that old geezer said we was lookin' for a place over the sea, didn't 'e?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: An arch o' rock goin' over the water or somefin'.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We're so close to getting inside the Dark Ruins!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I can hardly wait to get my hands on Dhoulmagus!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Use the mirror to deflect the spell of a sea monster, and it'll absorb the spell's magical energy. That was what he said, wasn't it?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But there's more than one fish in the sea, as they say. Which monster's spell are we looking for exactly?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Once we've dispelled the dark aura, all that remains is to defeat Dhoulmagus!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: The end of this torturous journey is finally in sight!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm pretty excited about this sun mirror.\nWot d'ya think's gonna 'appen when we use it to get rid o' the dark aura?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It's been 'ard enough to get 'old o' the thing.\nI'll be well disappointed if it don't go through it like Munchie though a block o' cheese!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: So what are we going to do if this sun mirror doesn't work as promised?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Then we just hang around at the entrance to the Dark Ruins and wait for Dhoulmagus to come out. He's got to surface at some point.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why the 'ell didn't ya think o' that before, ya lemon!?\nThat woulda been loads easier!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: You haven't a brain between you!\nThe longer we procrastinate, the more suffering the people of Trodain will be forced to endure!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Whatever minor hardships YOU have to suffer in comparison, our mission remains the same: defeat Dhoulmagus! And as quickly as possible!", true],
