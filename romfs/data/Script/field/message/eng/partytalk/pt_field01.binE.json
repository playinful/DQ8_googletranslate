		["<se_low>King Trode: That good-for-nothing villain!\nWhat does he think he's doing this time!?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: We can't just stand by and do nothing! Angelo mentioned a secret passage from the ruin. We must go there at once!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: A jester!? I can't believe it's just a coincidence! If it is Dhoulmagus who's broken into Abbot Francisco's room, we can't let him get away!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: There was a beautiful full moon that night Dhoulmagus attacked Abbot Francisco...", true],
		["Angelo: ............", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Hopefully nothing like that will happen this time. All this death and killing is getting rather tedious.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: I'm all for helping people out of a predicament, but we've no idea now where Dhoulmagus has run off to.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: He must've have come in this direction from Alexandria.\nHow could he have slipped through our fingers!?", true],

		["<se_low>King Trode: It's absolutely outrageous!\nDetouring off into a cave like that without so much as a by your leave!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: People say me old town o' Pickham's full o' crooks an' the like, but it's actually not a bad place really.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Not much point givin' it to 'er after all these years...", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: I had been starting to wonder whether King Trode really is a king, but that little display has taken care of any doubts.", true],

		["<se_low>King Trode: He lives in my castle, doesn't he!?\nSo that makes him one of my subjects.\nIt's quite simple!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: ...It might be an idea to leave him behind. Come on, let's go and see Ishmahri!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: With the Moonshadow harp, we should be able to return the ship to the sea once more.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Then we'll be able to follow Dhoulmagus to the west. He won't elude us for much longer!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Let's go, <leader>!\nIt's time to pay Ishmahri a visit!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've got the harp! Now all we have to do is take it back to Ishmahri and he can use it to get the ship moving again.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: This is so exciting! Come on, let's hurry! Back to Trodain Castle and through the Moonshadow window!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Well, it was pretty tough but we got there in the end. We finally have the Moonshadow harp!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Now we'll have our own ship at last.\nIf Ishmahri's to be believed anyway.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's head over to Trodain Castle.\nIt's time to go back through the Moonshadow window and pay Ishmahri another visit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I've been thinkin'.\nWe ain't never really been on a long boat journey together before, eh, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Shame we can't rustle up a few deckchairs an' enjoy it a bit more, but I s'pose chasin' Dhoulmagus comes first.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Come on then, guv.\nLet's go an' give the 'arp back to that Itchy-Marie bloke.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: D'you really think a measly little 'arp can move a great big ship like that?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: All that stuff about the sea's memories bein' woke up an' ev'ryfin'. Sounds like a load o' rubbish if you ask me.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What was it that he said, that Ishmahri character?\nSomething about awakening the sea's memories?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's rather a strange concept to get your head round... Still, no need for us to bother with the details.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's just head back to Trodain Castle and go through the Moonshadow window in the library.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It just looks like any old harp to me.\nI suppose it must be the real thing, though.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Otherwise they wouldn't have gone to all that trouble to steal it.\nProbably. No, surely.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: There's nothing.\nNo ship, no sea...\nIt's as if they never existed.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That guy...Ishmahri.\nWhere do you think he came from?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We didn't really need that 'arp, y'know.\nI could've pushed the boat all the way to the sea no probs.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Still, wot's done's done.\nAt least we've got it goin' again now.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: There must have been a fairly large city here in the old days for them to have built such a huge ship.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And yet now there's nothing left.\nIt's such a pity...\nWait! Did I just say that?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Thank goodness! I was actually getting kind of tired of all that walking.\nNow I can have a rest at last!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Eh, them two peddlers look like they might 'ave a few bob.\nIt'd be a pushover, I reckon...", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: !!!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I mean, er...!\nIt ain't like it sounds, guv!\nI'm still goin' straight, I swear!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I had high hopes when we first arrived here, but this continent's not got much going for it really.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Um, don't you think we should make the ship our first priority? We need to go to Trodain Castle and find out more about it.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I guess it's okay to take a detour, but we shouldn't waste too much time.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It was that Dhoulmagus who covered the castle wiv thorns then, eh? There's prob'ly monsters inside.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Maybe we should go an' do a bit of confessin' in church first, guv. Make sure this Goddess is on our side an' all that. Better safe than sorry!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: You know, we've still got unfinished business at Trodain Castle.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: The troll king said we should go to the library and find out about the ship.\nDon't want to disobey orders now!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: The landslide must have caused them no end of trouble here.\nI doubt they had any customers at all.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: If me old thievin' instincts are anythin' to go by, the Moonshadow 'arp ain't nowhere round 'ere.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: There's not a whiff o' treasure about the place.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: This hardly seems a likely place for treasure.\nI think we may be barking up the wrong tree here.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We're wasting our time just wandering around in the mountains like this.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: There's nothing.\nNo ship, no sea...\nIt's as if they never existed.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That guy...Ishmahri.\nWhere do you think he came from?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We didn't really need that 'arp, y'know.\nI could've pushed the boat all the way to the sea no probs.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Still, wot's done's done.\nAt least we've got it goin' again now.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: There must have been a fairly large city here in the old days for them to have built such a huge ship.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And yet now there's nothing left.\nIt's such a pity...\nWait! Did I just say that?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Did you hear that!?\nThat guy said something about a ship!\nA ship!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe that weird shape out in the wasteland is a ship!\nWe should go and take a closer look!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Me eyes may not be the most attractivest ever, but at least they can see a long way.", true],
		["Yangus: ............", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Blimey! That's amazin'! Guv!\nIt's incredible! We'd better go an' give this the once over!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: A mountain the shape of a ship?\nSounds like someone has a bit of an over[-]active imagination.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Still, we don't have anything else to go on at the moment.\nI suppose we'd better go and have a look.", true],
		["Jessica: ..............................", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Um... Can we get out of here?\nI feel kind of uncomfortable.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It feels good standin' on the edge of a buildin' like that. I do it meself sometimes.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What are you talking to me for?\nI don't have the answers to everything, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Hey, Morrie's calling us.\nWe should go over.\nI can't think of anything worse, but still.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: All that stuff about listenin' to the wind's pretty cool, eh, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Maybe when I get older I can start 'avin' the odd chat wiv nature meself.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Morrie, hm...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Morrie's getting a bit frantic!\nDon't you think we should go over?\nI can't think of anything worse, but still.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Nice. When it comes to manners an' all that, that bloke's got style.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Morrie, yeah...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Morrie's memos... Yeah, I'm not really sure what it's all about, but I guess if we look at the memos we should be able to figure it out.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: So all we 'ave to do is find an' defeat the monsters on them memos. Sounds like a doddle!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: If only people always told it to ya as straight as 'im, eh!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: As you can probably tell, I'm a man of much experience. I know more than I'd care to know sometimes.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But never before have I come across a man like him.\nHe's one of a kind.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We don't really have time to get too caught up with this Morrie guy, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I'm supposed to be avenging my brother's death.\nThat's why I teamed up with you.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: A \u2018miracolo\u2019, eh? That sounds a bit excitin'! I'm all aquiver!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Remind me again what it is I'm supposed to be doing on this trip?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Never mind.\nLet's just take care of Morrie's memos when we get the chance along the way.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Ah, you're back!\nHave you found any clues to Dhoulmagus's whereabouts?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Why don't we meet with Abbot Francisco and see if he can be of any assistance?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I was planning on giving that silly man his ring back along with a piece of my mind! But I suppose I'll let him off just this once.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That's not important compared to finding a lead on Dhoulmagus. Why don't we ask the people at the abbey if they have any ideas?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I thought it would be all peaceful at an abbey, like, wot wiv 'em all bein' monks. Looks like it ain't quite that simple, though, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Anyway, maybe the big boss 'ere will know somefin' about Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's go an' see wot this Abbot Francisco fella 'as to say for 'imself!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: We seem to have completed a lap of the entire world!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: I do hope you're ready for battle now?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: If you don't hurry up and defeat this Rhapthorne, <leader>, everything we hold dear will be destroyed.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: All of the places we've been, the paths we've trodden... They'll all be obliterated by hideous monsters!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Understood? You have to win, and you have to come back safely! Losing is not an option!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've finally cornered the Lord of Darkness! We've come too far to mess this up now. We'd never live it down.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: If you 'adn't come by the bridge that day, I'd prob'ly still be a bandit, guv.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: An' I'd 'ave been pestified o' monsters an' red skies an' the like. Absolutely quiverin' in me boots!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Do you think the Lord of Darkness is watching us from up there? Or do you think he couldn't care less what we do?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Either way, we're going to defeat him! The sky will look a heck of a lot better without him in it.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: That dark shield is rather tiresome. How frustrating that it makes Rhapthorne immune to attack.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: We must hurry and do as Empyrea said. If we don't collect the seven orbs, we won't be able to fight him at all.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Ohhh, but it is all just so tiresome! TIRESOME, I tell you!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I've grown so much since our journey began...\nI thought my mastery of magic would give me the edge over almost anyone.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But Rhapthorne is just too strong. My powers are nothing to him.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We prob'ly shouldn't stand about chattin' too much, guv.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Empyrea might fly past, see us slackin' off, an' give us a nasty peckin' if we ain't careful!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: The monsters are looking more and more menacing by the hour... I don't like this.", true],
		["<se_high>Red: Wot, are you lookin' for some place to 'ide away so Rhapthorne don't find ya or somefin'?\nYer wastin' yer time. An' mine! There ain't nowhere that's safe.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: I do not like this wind I am feeling. It is because of the Rhapthorne up in the sky. It makes me sick to my stomaco!", true]
