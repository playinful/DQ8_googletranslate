		["<se_high>Jessica: Hah! I knew it! I know why YOU like it so much! You like the scanty outfits the women wear. I'm onto your little game!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You don't? But that stone gate thing's really amazing, don't you think?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That's what I think, anyway. But apparently you don't share my appreciation of beautiful and unique cultural relics... Oh well, your loss!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It seems this isn't a village of wild savages after all.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I had my doubts about an island cut off from the outside world, but this is a pleasant surprise.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Wot d'ya think this \u2018Dark Eye\u2019 thing's all about then, eh? I ain't got a clue.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If we want to fight Rhapthorne, we're going to need Empyrea's help.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But how can we talk to a shadow?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I guess we should just cross that bridge when we come to it. We'd better find her shadow first.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I don't think we should necessarily pay too much attention to someone as senile<endash> ...I mean, senior, as that old man.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It all sounds a bit far-fetched to me. Superstition, at best. But superfluous gibberish would probably be closer to the truth.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Quiet as ever, eh, this village!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Lookin' around, ya start to think maybe it's all a dream. Ya know, goin' to another world an' all that.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: I really thought the 'ole place'd be a burnt-out wreck by now.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: For some reason I expected the people of Empycchu to stay calm in the face of what's happening to the world.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But they're just as tense as people everywhere else. More, perhaps.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Then again, I'm sure they're only getting incomplete reports of what's happening.\nThat would make anyone jumpy.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: With all these folk tales of the great struggle they had with Rhapthorne, you'd have thought someone might have given us a clue about his weaknesses.", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: Personally, I prefer the object of my affections to be a little more...physical.", true],
		["<se_high>Red: This World o' Darkness is a funny old place, eh? S'pose we better follow that Empyrea-wotsit's shadow an' see where it gets us...", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: The gigantesca shadow, it was from the Godbird, ay? She is guiding us up the path to the World of the Darkness?", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: I cannot imagine what is lying in the waiting room for us in this new world. But I am sure there will be many monsters we have never seen before! FANTASTICO!", true],
		["<se_high>Red: If we wanna make any progress, we'll prob'ly 'ave better luck in the World o' Darkness than 'angin' around 'ere, right?", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: The divine bird, Empyrea, has expended us with an invitazione, ay? We must <endash> How do you say it? <endash> shake our legs, ay?", true],

		["<se_high>Red: S'pose it's cos they're passed down by word o' mouth. No one bothers tellin' the borin' stories. Or if they do, no one else bothers repeatin' 'em.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Allora, if there is this village where the people are idolising the Empyrea, maybe some place there is a village where they are idolising the Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: And maybe they are thinking he is the leggendario deity, and WE and Empyrea are the black caps, ay? CRAZY!", true]
