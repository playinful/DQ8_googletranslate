		["<se_low>Yangus: I actually feel a bit sorry for the old codger. Bet you never thought you'd see the day!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I set off on this journey to avenge my brother's death, and yet here I am babysitting this creep!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Poor Princess Medea. Even if she's freed from this curse, she has to marry that awful Charmless.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If I were the Princess, I'd rather stay as a horse than marry that guy!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: I mean it'll be hard to decide where to live once we've taken care of Dhoulmagus.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: It's been a long time coming, but now we can finally focus on defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: So this mirror can only be recharged by a single type of spell!?\nTalk about picky!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Just think how much easier this would be if my magic were enough to make it work again!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe this monster will be really ill and at death's door...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And let me guess! It'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: But the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, or something... And what are we going to do then?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All we have to do is use the mirror to absorb a spell and then its magic will be restored.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose not just any old spell will do? Of course it couldn't possibly be that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We better get a move on an' take care of any outstandin' business now.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Cos once we break down the dark aura an' go into them Dark Ruins, we ain't comin' back 'til we've sorted Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Angelo, are you going to leave the Templars when we've defeated Dhoulmagus?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: That's the plan. I don't want to be around my brother any more for one thing.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And the Abbot was my only real friend at the abbey. Once I've avenged his death, I won't have any more ties with the place.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why d'you 'ate your brother so much, eh? You've only got the one, after all. Shouldn't you 'ave a bash at gettin' on?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's him who hates me. I don't have any feelings for him at all... None whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry up back to the Dark Ruins. Hopefully that mirror we spent so much effort getting hold of will take us to Dhoulmagus at last.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When we got the magic mirror in Argonia, I thought we were just a breath away from defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But this should be the end of the distractions. Now it's time to finish him off once and for all!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm well pleased that I could take you an' the old codger to Pickham on our travels!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I don't get why Angelo didn't take to the place. Such a pity! Ha ha ha!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If Alistair lost to this guy, we should be ready for a tough fight!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Te he he he hee!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You've got a cheek talking about me like that! And what's with the weird laugh anyway!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I have to avenge the Abbot's death before I can properly draw a line under my life at the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When I first set off, I was under orders and nothing more. But now I feel like this is my own duty.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: D'you think Jessica went off because she don't like us, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah? You reckon that could be it, eh? Maybe I said summat to upset 'er. I mean, untension'bly, like.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: In that case, we've gotta find 'er again so's I can say sorry.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Hey, 'ere's a thought... Maybe she got caught up in somefin' weird and got kidnapped!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I dunno! Listen to me goin' on! I'm well confused!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's a bit strange not having Jessica around. I'd almost go so far as to say I miss her. A bit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one. She's a brave one, that Jess. You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We should ask after Jessica in Argonia rather than just wandering around aimlessly.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's ask first and look later.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: The King and the palace guards are doing everything they can.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: So we have to give it everything we've got too.\nWe have to defeat Rhapthorne. We HAVE to win!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Everyone seems bloomin' terrified o' the bright red sky. They look like they're ready to do a runner any second. Dunno where, mind.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: All this panic from a little bit o' colour in the sky! Who knows wot's gonna 'appen if Rhapthorne gets serious?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We can't let 'im, guv!\nWe've gotta sort Rhapthorne out before 'e messes the 'ole world up!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's strange, don't you think?\nWhen there are people around, you can forget about the terror for a while.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: In towns and casinos, where people are just carrying on as normal, it's easy to think everything that's happened is nothing but a bad dream.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But it isn't.\nThe red sky isn't, and Rhapthorne isn't.\nThey're all too real.<page>Angelo: You'd be hammering the nails into your own coffin if you pretended everything was fine.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Inside wardrobes, down wells... We've gotta look anywhere an' everywhere for them orbs!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: If you ain't 'appy wiv snoopin' about cos it makes ya feel a bit like a thief, just leave it to me! I'm yer man!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If Rhapthorne's monsters attack Ascantha, the kingdom is as good as fallen.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We really don't have any time to waste. We have to find the orbs and penetrate Rhapthorne's dark shield!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Come on, use your head. We're not just carrying that flute around for the fun of it, you know.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Why not make use of it if it's made for the job? Find a likely spot and get playing!", true],
		["<se_high>Red: The people round 'ere are all doin' the best they can to fight the threat, eh? All we gotta do is show Rhapthorne wot for.", true],
		["<se_high>Red: Anyway, it'll be okay. If we keep on at 'im, we'll wear 'im down in the end. We'll 'ave 'im this time, you'll see.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: The guards here, they are busting their gums to protect the castello and the town. I think we have been nothing for worrying, ay?", true]
