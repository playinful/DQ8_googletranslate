		["<se_high>Jessica: Red's so angry all the time!\nDoes she really hate Yangus that much?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Come on, guv! Please! Anyone but 'er!\nI'll go an' see anyone else ya want.\nJust not Red! I'm beggin' ya!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What's wrong with Red?\nShe prefers something a little more burly, does she?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Shame. She's a fine-looking woman.\nIt really is an inexcusable waste.", true],
