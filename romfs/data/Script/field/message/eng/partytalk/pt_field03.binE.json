		["<se_low>King Trode: ...<Cap><leader>, it's imperative that we find those seven orbs and defeat him! Consider that an order!", true],

		["<se_low>King Trode: We must be strong, <leader>.\nThe fate of the world rests on our shoulders.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: This is the first time this 'as ever 'appened to\nme. Meetin' someone wiv a bigger belly than\nmine, I mean. That Rhapthorne's a right porker!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Empyrea's right. I don't reckon we stand much chance of beatin' 'im as we are now.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Once we collect all seven orbs, we'll be able to use the power of the great sages to penetrate the dark shield surrounding Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: In other words, the quicker we find them, the quicker we can give the Lord of Darkness his comeuppance! Let's go!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: This doesn't look good. Even the small fry are getting stronger by the day.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If we're not careful, we'll be had by Rhapthorne's minions before we've even\nmanaged to find the orbs.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Brrrrr! I-It's so c-c-cold!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: B-But I suppose we'll all be f-freezing in our g-graves if we don't find the s-seven orbs.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Right, <leader>! Hurry up and f-find those orbs before Medea and I c-catch our death of c-c-cold!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Come to think of it, there was some stone carvin' or other goin' on about the seven sages in the cave behind Marta's 'ouse.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Maybe we'll be able to get some kinda clue there, eh?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's g-g-get out of here before my g-g-gums freeze and my t-t-teeth ch-ch-chatter themselves out of my mouth!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: We don't have time to stand about and chat! Keep moving. We're supposed to be finding orbs.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Empyrea won't be impressed if we don't come up with the goods soon. And we wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of her, I'll wager.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Do you want to turn into a snowman or something? Is that why you've come here!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If we don't get back to Empyrea soon, she'll give us a painful demonstration of our place in the pecking order.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Hmm... Empyrea said there are seven orbs scattered around the world, each filled with the power of one of the seven sages.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: If we collect them all, we'll be able to break that evil rascal Rhapthorne's dark shield...", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: So we need to find them! No sense in dilly<->dallying here. Let the orb hunt commence!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I was well impressed when Empyrea saved us from that fat geezer, Rhapthorne!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: But there's been somefin' botherin' me actually, guv...", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: When old Rhapthorne's gaff fell apart like it did, I'm sure I saw somefin' shiny in all the rubble fallin' down towards Neos.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm thinkin', if we go an' 'ave a butcher's around the 'oly city, maybe we'll find it. Could be some treasure we missed when we was goin' through the city-dell before.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: I really think it could be treasure, guv!\nCome on, let's go an' 'ave a shufti, eh?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: So now that the Black Citadel has fallen,\nwe finally see the true extent of Rhapthorne's power.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I hate to admit it, but Empyrea's right.\nThere's no way we can defeat Rhapthorne as things stand.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We need to find those seven orbs.\nThey contain the power of the sages.\nIt's the only way. Let's go!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We haven't time to dawdle. Have you never heard of the concept of concentration?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We need to find a likely spot and try out that flute. Then the echo, or lack of it, should tell us if there's an orb around or not.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Medea and I will be waiting here while you and Empyrea fight Rhapthorne. We wouldn't want to be in your way.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: You just make sure you defeat him and come back safely, do you hear?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's go! Time to give them orbs to Empyrea an' take on Rhapthorne at last!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Heh heh! The lardy Lord o' Darkness ain't gonna know wot's 'it 'im this time.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Don't you worry. We're right behind you!\nAnd King Trode and Princess Medea are with you as well.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Not to mention the Godbird Empyrea, and even the orbs containing the souls of the great sages. All of us are in this together.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's take care of Rhapthorne once and for all. It's high time the world was rid of him!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So, the moment of truth has arrived.\nNo doubt Empyrea's ready and waiting.\nShall we go?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: (Sigh...)\nSearching about all over the place for orbs really makes one realise how big the world is.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: ...Not that there's any sense in grumbling,\nI suppose. Best foot forward, and all that!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Sorry, guv. I sorta feel like me bandit's nose should be able to sniff out them orbs,\nbut I ain't even got a whiff of 'em.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: You'd be better off usin' that flute Empyrea give us. Toot-oot-ot! \u266a Much more useful than anyfin' I can tell ya at the moment.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I suppose it was a bit too early to start thinking we'd finally cornered Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But we're almost there. We can pierce his dark shield so long as we have the seven orbs.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And once we penetrate the shield, there won't\nbe anything stopping us from attacking him!\nSo let's find those orbs! ", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Use your head. Even if we comb every single place in the world, we'll probably only end up with sore feet to show for it.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: The orbs in some way represent the sages, right? So that should give you an idea of where to start at the very least.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: The monsters 'round 'ere 'ave got quite a bit stronger, eh? I 'ope the old man we met at the spring's awright.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We'd better get a wriggle on, find them orbs and give Rhapthorne a good 'idin'!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I think it's safe to assume there aren't any orbs in the grass around here, don't you?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: They're called sages' orbs, so surely they're all in places with connections to......the sages!?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Just in case you haven't realised, Argon hearts may be shiny round stones, but they most certainly aren't orbs.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Those orbs contain the power of the legendary seven sages! It would be most rude to confuse them with those pesky lizard jewels!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It'd be a right pain if one o' them orbs was in Argonia Castle, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: That place is so complexicated, it makes me 'ead spin!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Enjoy your sneering while you can, Rhapthorne. Because your time is running out.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: The moment we find all of the orbs, we'll have everything we need to pierce that shield of yours and take you down!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I don't understand you sometimes. You have the echo flute, you can use Zoom, and you can fly.<page>Angelo: So why are you insisting on going around on foot to find these orbs!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If it's a matter of principle or something,\nI won't say another word. But at least try to hurry up a bit.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: So now all that's left is to return to Empyrea and fight the last battle... It's been a long journey, when you think about it.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: And its conclusion is all down to you, my boy. Don't let me down now!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I can sense the power within the orbs.\nIt's almost as if they're asking us to go and\nfight Rhapthorne.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry back and talk to Empyrea!", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Ah. If I remember correctly, this island is the site of those dreadful Dark Ruins built in honour of Rhapthorne.<page>King Trode: I hardly think there'll be an orb here.", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Not that we have any other leads, mind.\nKeep looking, <leader>!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Wot d'ya reckon'll 'appen when we've collected all the orbs? I ain't got a clue, meself.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Next to the Black Citadel itself, I think this is the most evil place I've ever set foot in. You can just feel the dark power coursing through.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I seriously doubt we'll find any of the orbs around here.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose this was something of a \u2018holy\u2019 island for Rhapthorne's followers, what with those Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's hard to believe people worshipped him enough to build a shrine to him. What were they thinking!?", true],
		["<se_low>King Trode: Hm, far be it from me to doubt young Jessica, but there appears to be nothing out of the ordinary here in the desert at present.", true],
