		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: And let me guess! It'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: But the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, or something... And what are we going to do then?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All we have to do is use the mirror to absorb a spell and then its magic will be restored.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose not just any old spell will do?\nOf course it couldn't possibly be that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get this out of the way sharpish, eh.\nWe don't 'ave time to faff about.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We ain't goin' 'ome 'til we've given Dhoulmagus the wot-for in the Dark Ruins, so we'll just 'ave to do wot it takes to get at 'im.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry up back to the Dark Ruins.\nHopefully that mirror we spent so much effort getting hold of will take us to Dhoulmagus at last.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When we got the magic mirror in Argonia, I thought we were just a breath away from defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But this should be the end of the distractions.\nNow it's time to finish him off once and for all!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm well pleased that I could take you an' the old codger to Pickham on our travels!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I dunno! Listen to me goin' on! I'm well confused!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's a bit strange not having Jessica around. I'd almost go so far as to say I miss her. A bit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one.\nShe's a brave one, that Jess.<page>Yangus: You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We should ask after Jessica in Argonia rather than just wandering around aimlessly.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: An' neither do you, guv, sneakin' into a place like this!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: To be honest, at times like this, I really don't enjoy visiting all of the places we've been to before.<page>Jessica: It's<endash> I don't know.\nIt's like we're getting ready to die or something.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: The Abbot may know where Dhoulmagus is hiding.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm all for 'avin' a break, guv, 'specially down the pub. But 'adn't we better try an' get a bit more o' the low-down on Dhoulmagus?", true],
