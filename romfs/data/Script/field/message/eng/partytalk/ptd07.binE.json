		["<se_low>Yangus: Me old mates in Pickham often talked about the legend'ry pirate, Captain Crow. We was always wond'rin' 'ow to get our 'ands on 'is treasure!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Rumour 'as it that it's 'idden in a cave somewhere.\nMaybe this is the place!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I never knew there was a cave here!\nAnd it's quite close to Alexandria, too!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: It just goes to show. Even though it was practically under my nose, I never would have noticed it if I hadn't joined forces with you guys!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: This cave is enormous.\nI can't believe it was big enough for us to come into by ship!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: No doubt there have been some fairly shady goings-on here over the years, as well.<page>Angelo: Bound to be, with it being so hidden away from view like that.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm obviously a bit worried about Red, but it ain't just that.\nI used to be a bandit an' all, y'see.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: So talk o' Captain Crow's treasure gets me well excited!", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Good ol' Captain Crow, 'idin' 'is treasure in a complexicated cave like this!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: There's bound to be more traps ahead to try an' stop people findin' it.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We'd better watch 'ow we go, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: That bird's unbelievable!\nShe really wants this treasure, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Well if we don't get a wriggle on, she's gonna 'ave it from under our noses!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Red seems to be out cold.\nCome on, this is a golden opportunity!<page>Jessica: Let's grab the contents of the treasure chest before she wakes up!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: After all, we fought Captain Crow fair and square. Even he agrees!\nSo she won't have any reason to complain.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: It looks like Red was right!\nWe really don't have much luck!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We may have figured out the trick, but SHE'S the one to benefit from it! Grrr...!", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Why does she 'ave to make me feel like a loser even though I won!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Makes ya think about Captain Crow's glory days, bein' 'ere in this cave.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: ...Not that I really know much about 'em, mind.\nI'm just imaginin' really.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I remember hearing something about a sea chart before. I don't know if it was the same as this one, though.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And I also remember something about a Godbird Island. What was it, again? Hmm...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Remember the silly competition we had with Red here?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: When she got to the treasure ahead of us, I was sure we'd lost!\nThat was a close one.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So all we have to show for our efforts is a measly piece of paper.\nDo you really think it's going to be of any use?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What's wrong, <hero>?\nYou're not thinking there's more pirate treasure hidden somewhere else, are you?", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: It's been a while now since we raced against Red 'ere to get Captain Crow's treasure.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Er, guv. Ya don't think we should let you-know-who pull out o' this lark before it gets too dangerous, do ya?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: ...Nah, never mind.\nIt's nuffin'. I was just mumblin' to meself.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Thanks to the sea chart we found here, we met Empyrea. And thanks to helping her, we were given the ability to fly.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And now the ability to fly means that we can fight Rhapthorne. So I suppose we owe a big debt of gratitude to Captain Crow!", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: As good as, maybe, but not better! If we don't do something, she's going to beat us to it!", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Maybe she's a little too fortunato, ay, our rosa rossa? She shows up just as we're unlocking the door? No no, this is no accident!", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Where is the treasure, is the rosa rossa. Like you spend a bad penny, ay?", true],
		["<se_high>Red: Well, that's that then. Not exactly a great 'aul,\nis it? Legend'ry pirate? I reckon ev'ryone's been 'avin' a laugh.", true],

		["<se_high>Red: Nuffin' doin' 'ere now. No treasure at all.", true],
		["<se_high>Red: Well, old Crow's ghost never said nuffin' about no other treasure about, so we're through 'ere, as far as I'm concerned.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: If the map tells us something about the Godbird we are looking for, then we are in luck, ay? But can you make the sense out of it?", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Si, I wanna be like this Capitano Crow <endash> a true leggenda. Morrie, leggenda of the monstrous pit! Monster team owner extraordinaire!", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: But then maybe people are gonna come looking in my house for the precious mementos of the great man, ay?", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Hmmm, maybe I better throw some things away I don't wanna no one to see...", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: If an amico is in difficolta, we cannot stand beside and do nothing, ay? Even if we are face to face with a pirata leggendario!", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: We must find our GUSTO and save the rosa rossa! But we are fighting with a spirito. Don't let the ghost get you, ay?", true],
		["<se_high>Red: Blimey, it feels like an age ago when we was battlin' it out 'ere for old Crow's treasure, eh?", true],
		["<se_high>Red: And when I said I'd tag along wiv ya, I never thought I'd end up 'avin' to join in the fight against the Lord o' Darkness, I can tell ya.", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Aha! Si, an excellent idea! Here, in this deep cave, the Rhapthorne will not see us making the battle plans, ay?", true],
