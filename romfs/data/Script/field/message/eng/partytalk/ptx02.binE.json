		["<se_low>Yangus: It was that Dhoulmagus who covered the castle wiv thorns then, eh? There's prob'ly monsters inside.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Maybe we should go an' do a bit of confessin' in church first, guv. Make sure this Goddess is on our side an' all that. Better safe than sorry!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: You know, we've still got unfinished business at Trodain Castle.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I thought old freaky-features said we should look for something in the library. It's disrespectful not to listen to what he says, you know.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I hope you aren't planning to ask that Templar jerk about the Moonshadow harp!", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Ascantha ain't far from 'ere.\nThe Moonshadow 'arp's ours now!\nCome on! Get ready for a sprint!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's hardly been any time since I left the place, but the abbey already feels very alien to me. Or am I being overly sentimental?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Never mind.\nLet's just ask what we came to ask, and leave.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Marcello loves to study.\nHe's memorised every book in the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: ...Always chewing over the facts, digesting the evidence...\nQuite a bookworm, he is.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Aren't we supposed to go through the tunnel in Ascantha Castle and find the thieves who stole the Moonshadow harp?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We'd better hurry up and give chase before it's too late! Come on!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: They're pretty strong for a bunch of moles!\nThis is crazy!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We can't let them beat us. Let's go back and show them what we're really made of!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: There's this place north of Ascantha surrounded by mountains. The only way to get there's by diggin' an 'ole.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Not a bad place for a thief's 'ideout, I reckon. Maybe that's where the geezer who stole the Moonshadow 'arp is.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get a move on back to Ascantha Castle!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We ain't lettin' them moles keep the Moonshadow 'arp!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Moles... I dunno!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Just thinkin' about that awful racket the fat one made is enough to bring me dinner back up! Uuurgh!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I know the King said he'd summon his men and all that...", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But it's King Pavan, right?\nHardly the most dynamic person we've ever met.\nWe'd better take care of this ourselves.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: These moles won't get the better of us.\nRight?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We'd better make sure we show them who's boss this time, or we'll never live it down!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've got the harp! Now all we have to do is take it back to Ishmahri and he can use it to get the ship moving again.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Come on, let's hurry back to Trodain Castle! We've got to get back into that weird moon world!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I've been thinkin'.\nWe ain't never really been on a long boat journey together before, eh, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Shame we can't rustle up a few deckchairs an' enjoy it a bit more, but I s'pose chasin' Dhoulmagus comes first.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Come on then, guv.\nLet's go an' give the 'arp back to that Itchy-Marie bloke.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What was it that he said, that Ishmahri character?\nSomething about awakening the sea's memories?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's rather a strange concept to get your head round... Still, no need for us to bother with the details.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's just head back to Trodain Castle and go through the Moonshadow window in the library.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: What a nasty place. Is this really an abbey? It certainly doesn't feel like one.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Dhoulmagus came from Farebury to Alexandria to the abbey 'ere, an' then crossed the ocean to the west, right?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Come on then, guv! Let's get the ship 'eaded west!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So it seems Marcello has become Abbot while retaining his title of Templar Captain.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What a busy man he is!\nNo doubt he couldn't be happier with his promotion, however self-styled it was.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I absolutely cannot stand the sight of that stupid man!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But I'll drop it this once.\nBecause he told us the harp's in Ascantha.\nI should be grateful for that.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That doesn't mean I'll keep quiet if he ever talks down to us again, though!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Ascantha ain't far from 'ere.\nThe Moonshadow 'arp's ours now!\nCome on! Get ready for a sprint!", true],
		["Angelo: .........", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We've got the information we came for.\nThere's no need to hang around here any longer.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: What IS his problem?\nAfter we go to the effort to keep him informed, he treats us like that?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Who does he think he is?\nEverything about that idiot upsets me.\nIf I never saw him again, it'd be too soon!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I still don't like that bloke, but wot 'e said's right.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Findin' that ship an' the Moonshadow 'arp's all part o' the same game at the end o' the day: gettin' Dhoulmagus!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I need to fix that prop'ly into me 'ead, or else I'm gonna forget wot we're tryin' to do.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I've left the abbey now.\nI no longer have a duty to report my movements to my seniors.<page>Angelo: In fact, they're not even my seniors any more, are they!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So let's go!\nTo Trodain, I believe?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It's a shame Grandad and that Charmless bloke can't see eye to eye.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I actually feel a bit sorry for the old codger.\nBet you never thought you'd see the day!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I set off on this journey to avenge my brother's death, and yet here I am babysitting this creep!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Poor Princess Medea.\nEven if she's freed from this curse, she has to marry that awful Charmless.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If I were the Princess, I'd rather stay as a horse than marry that guy!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I've got it! We should find the Princess a nice 'orse-faced bloke wiv goofy teeth an' a long nose! It's the perfect solution!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How is that perfect!?\nA horse can't marry a human, you idiot!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Ah, it's good to get away from Charmless for a while.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: He's always lording it over us!\nHow's a man supposed to relax in these conditions!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Well that was a bleedin' nightmare! Who'd 'ave thought that 'angin' out wiv royals would be this much of a pain!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Once we've got the magic mirror from Argonia, we can finally get back to concentrating on Dhoulmagus again.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What a prize ass that Charmless is, getting on Medea's back like that!\nImagine if he knew she was his fianc\u00e9e!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's fair enough that he doesn't realise, though. A man doesn't expect his future bride to turn up in a bridle!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Lookin' after that Charmless was a right 'eadache. I almost forgot why we was doin' it for a while.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: But we've got that magic mirror now, so we can finally get through to Dhoulmagus in the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've had to take a few detours, but finally we can concentrate on Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's good that we managed to get the royal treasure at last, but the things that scholar was saying are a bit worrying.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All that talk about there being no magic in the mirror any more...\nIt doesn't look promising.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When you travel around so much like this, you end up with too many choices.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And what's that supposed to mean?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I mean it'll be hard to decide where to live once we've taken care of Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: You should all probably start thinking about what you're going to do once it's over too.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I've already got that sorted!\nI'm gonna stick with the guv 'ere for good!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You really LOVE the GUV, huh!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Lookin' after that Charmless was a right 'eadache. I almost forgot why we was doin' it for a while.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: But we've got that magic mirror now, so we can finally get through to Dhoulmagus in the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It's a good job there's a way of gettin' magic back into the mirror, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Otherwise that prob'ly would've been the end of our journey.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've had to take a few detours, but finally we can concentrate on Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: What a nuisance that there's only one spell that can restore the magic to the mirror!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Think how much easier it would be if one of my spells worked on it!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When you travel around so much like this, you end up with too many choices.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And what's that supposed to mean?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I mean it'll be hard to decide where to live once we've taken care of Dhoulmagus.", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: All that talk about there being no magic in the mirror any more...\nIt doesn't look promising.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah. But at least ya know where you is wiv a monster, eh?\nNot like babysittin' princes an' the like.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Who knows!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe this monster will be really ill and at death's door...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And let me guess! It'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: But the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, or something... And what are we going to do then?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All we have to do is use the mirror to absorb a spell and then its magic will be restored.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose not just any old spell will do?\nOf course it couldn't possibly be that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get this out of the way sharpish, eh.\nWe don't 'ave time to faff about.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We ain't goin' 'ome 'til we've given Dhoulmagus the wot-for in the Dark Ruins, so we'll just 'ave to do wot it takes to get at 'im.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Angelo, are you going to leave the Templars when we've defeated Dhoulmagus?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: That's the plan.\nI don't want to be around my brother any more for one thing.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And the Abbot was my only real friend at the abbey. Once I've avenged his death, I won't have any more ties with the place.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why d'you 'ate your brother so much, eh?\nYou've only got the one, after all.\nShouldn't you 'ave a bash at gettin' on?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's him who hates me.\nI don't have any feelings for him at all...\nNone whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry up back to the Dark Ruins.\nHopefully that mirror we spent so much effort getting hold of will take us to Dhoulmagus at last.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When we got the magic mirror in Argonia, I thought we were just a breath away from defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But this should be the end of the distractions.\nNow it's time to finish him off once and for all!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm well pleased that I could take you an' the old codger to Pickham on our travels!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I don't get why Angelo didn't take to the place.\nSuch a pity! Ha ha ha!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If Alistair lost to this guy, we should be ready for a tough fight!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Te he he he hee!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You've got a cheek talking about me like that!\nAnd what's with the weird laugh anyway!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I have to avenge the Abbot's death before I can properly draw a line under my life at the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When I first set off, I was under orders and nothing more.\nBut now I feel like this is my own duty.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: D'you think Jessica went off because she don't like us, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah? You reckon that could be it, eh? Maybe I said summat to upset 'er. I mean, untension'bly, like.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: In that case, we've gotta find 'er again so's I can say sorry.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Hey, 'ere's a thought... Maybe she got caught up in somefin' weird and got kidnapped!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I dunno! Listen to me goin' on! I'm well confused!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's a bit strange not having Jessica around. I'd almost go so far as to say I miss her. A bit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one.\nShe's a brave one, that Jess.<page>Yangus: You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We should ask after Jessica in Argonia rather than just wandering around aimlessly.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's ask first and look later.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Wot's all the racket about!?\nAn'<endash> Phwoar! It smells like a brewery in 'ere!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I didn't think the Goddess approved o' drinkin' to excess, and these are the bleedin' clergy!<page>Yangus:If this is 'ow they're carryin' on, it really will be the end o' the world!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Sometimes I think about what poetic justice it would be to defeat Rhapthorne here, in the same place we first met Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: It's just a what-if sort of thing. Thoughts like that go through my mind whenever I lie awake, thinking about all the people he's killed.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Any trace of Marcello's scheming must've been lost in all the confusion.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Everyone in the abbey just blindly believes in the man, do they?\n...Ignorance is bliss!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I was planning on giving that silly man his ring back along with a piece of my mind! But I suppose I'll let him off just this once.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: That's not important compared to finding a lead on Dhoulmagus. Why don't we ask the people at the abbey if they have any ideas?", true],
