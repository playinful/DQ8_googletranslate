		["<se_high>Jessica: We've got to find Dhoulmagus before he strikes again. He's caused enough tragedy already.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Why would Dhoulmagus kill the owner of a casino? I can't fathom his motives. Maybe he has an ethical objection to gambling?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe he lost everything at roulette and went after Golding to clear his debt?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: That'd make 'im no different from a common crook. Trust me, I'd know!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It seems the townspeople don't know the truth yet.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: You know, about Golding.\nThe people who were at the Dark Ruins to avenge his death said so, didn't they?", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: When I first set off, I was under orders and nothing more. But now I feel like this is my own duty.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I was well narked to find the casino shut\nthe first time I come 'ere.\nI'd been lookin' forward to a few games.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It was almost as bad as the time I found out a wallet I'd nicked only 'ad two measly gold coins in it!", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: We was s'posed to be goin' to that Dragon Graveyard place to 'elp that Cash geezer.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: We should go an' let our 'air down in the casino one more time before we go off an' fight Rhapthorne. Not that I've got that much to let down, but still...", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Wiv a bit o' luck, we might win a decent stack o' tokens. Then we can go off into battle knowin' we've got a bit o' good fortune on our side.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: A bit of a boost like that'll do us no end o' good. We'll make easy work of 'im!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Guv!\nThere's a king squid on the rampage in town!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It can't be good when there's monsters comin' inta town, eh? I doubt they're very relaxin' to 'ave around.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Bet this is all cos o' that Lord o' Darkness an' all.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Now that I think about it, Rhapthorne must be behind the murder of Golding, too.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: At the time, I thought Dhoulmagus was just on a mindless killing spree.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I'm picturing Cash waiting for us all alone under the scorching desert sun...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Oooh...!", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: Seeing the casino up and running again makes me realise how much Cash and Carrie have grown up.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Is it just me, or does it look like the king squid and the townspeople are having fun in the water together?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I wonder if other towns and castles are having the same problem with monsters coming in?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I wouldn't be surprised.<page>Angelo: Ever since Rhapthorne was resurrected,\nthe monsters have been getting stronger and stronger. This could probably happen anywhere.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I bet it's 'im who's gettin' 'em all to go on the rampage.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: No, I don't think so. He doesn't seem to have any followers. He's hardly the kind of guy you'd want to be around.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I wonder if that king squid was actually sent here by Rhapthorne? You know, like an assassin?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Actually, thinking about it, I can't imagine Rhapthorne needing a squid's help. He seems to have the whole assassination thing nailed.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If only we could've saved Golding...or some[-]body...anybody...from Rhapthorne's evil grasp...", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Then he'd never have been resurrected and we wouldn't have had all this bother trying to save the world.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh yeah. Cash and Carrie are having that crazy trial of theirs to decide who takes over the casino.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Weren't we supposed to go along as Cash's bodyguards? I'd completely forgotten. Oh well. He's a big boy.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh yeah. Cash and Carrie are having that crazy trial of theirs to decide who takes over the casino.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Weren't we supposed to go along as Carrie's bodyguards? I'd completely forgotten.\nIt's not like me to keep a lady waiting.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: The end of the world is upon us!\nBut no one seems to be all that bothered.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose a burning red sky just isn't exciting enough to tear them away from a good old game of bingo!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Looks like there's a bit of a fuss about some monster coming into town.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Sounds interesting. Let's go and have a look.\nAnd I suppose we COULD offer our services and get rid of it for them.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Those people we saw fighting that king squid seemed a bit scared of Cash and Carrie, don't you think?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Not that I blame them. That pair would be a nightmare to work for, I'm sure.\nNot like our very own King Troll! Ha hah!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It's a bit of a shame, but ya can't leave monsters runnin' around town.\nThey can cause all kinds o' trouble.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I know we had to fight it, but I can't help but think that king squid was all right.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: It's a shame it couldn't speak our language.\nMaybe we could've negotiated with it...", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We've got some hush money now.\nOr should I say \u2018hush tokens\u2019?\nThat means it's time for a trip to the casino!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It'd be quicker to give the old echo flute a \u2018Toot-oot-ot! \u266a\u2019 rather than askin' about town.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: If we don't 'urry up an' find them seven orbs, Rhapthorne's gonna cause all kinds o' bother!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: According to Empyrea, the only way to defeat Rhapthorne is by collecting orbs that contain the power of the great sages.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I suppose that means the seven great sages will be together again, just like in the old legends. But this time, they'll be in the form of orbs.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Empyrea's not very helpful, is she? The least she could've done was collect these orbs for us.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh! This is turning into quite a chore.", true],

		["<se_high>Red: Back in lively old Baccarat at last, eh? Phew!", true],
		["<se_high>Red: The casino's full o' punters, that's for sure. Maybe I'll just do the rounds and see if I can't pick nuffin' out o' no pockets.", true],
