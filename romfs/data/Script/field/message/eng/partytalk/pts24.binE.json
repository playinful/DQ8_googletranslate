		["<se_high>Jessica: It's kind of annoying that we can only ride them from here, though.\nNot that I want to sound ungrateful or anything.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: So we're lookin' for a tree that four sabrecat statues point at, an' that ya can only see at dawn. Sounds a bit dodgy, if you ask me.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: But we said we'd do it now, so we'd better go an' 'ave a shufty, see wot it's all about.", true],

		["<se_high>Red: Our resident 'alf-'og Yangus don't exactly cut the mustard in that department, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Morrie: Is this a zoo, just for the sabrecats?\nOr maybe some kind of circus, ay?", true],
