		["<se_high>Jessica: They're pretty strong for a bunch of moles!\nThis is crazy!", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: The ship in the wasteland doesn't look anything like the ferry.\nIt's a totally different animal altogether.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I wonder why it looks so strange?\nAnd who on earth would've built such a thing?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Nice work, I guess.\nI can tell this isn't any ordinary harp.\nLook at the detail.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: But I don't have much interest in musical instruments.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Guv! Be a bit careful!\nYou shouldn't go showin' the 'arp to anyone an' everyone, y'know.<page>Yangus: Trust me, that's a sure fire way o' gettin' it nicked again!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Sorry for 'arpin' on at ya, but gettin' that 'arp was a job an' 'alf.\nAnd wivout it, we ain't goin' nowhere.<page>Yangus: So we better put it away an' make sure it don't come to no 'arm.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So one measly harp constitutes their national treasure? That's about what I'd expect of somewhere like Ascantha.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: I actually feel a bit sorry for the old codger.\nBet you never thought you'd see the day!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I set off on this journey to avenge my brother's death, and yet here I am babysitting this creep!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Poor Princess Medea.\nEven if she's freed from this curse, she has to marry that awful Charmless.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If I were the Princess, I'd rather stay as a horse than marry that guy!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I've got it! We should find the Princess a nice 'orse-faced bloke wiv goofy teeth an' a long nose! It's the perfect solution!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How is that perfect!?\nA horse can't marry a human, you idiot!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Ah, it's good to get away from Charmless for a while.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: He's always lording it over us!\nHow's a man supposed to relax in these conditions!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Well that was a bleedin' nightmare! Who'd 'ave thought that 'angin' out wiv royals would be this much of a pain!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Once we've got the magic mirror from Argonia, we can finally get back to concentrating on Dhoulmagus again.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: What a prize ass that Charmless is, getting on Medea's back like that!\nImagine if he knew she was his fianc\u00e9e!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's fair enough that he doesn't realise, though. A man doesn't expect his future bride to turn up in a bridle!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Lookin' after that Charmless was a right 'eadache. I almost forgot why we was doin' it for a while.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: But we've got that magic mirror now, so we can finally get through to Dhoulmagus in the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've had to take a few detours, but finally we can concentrate on Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's good that we managed to get the royal treasure at last, but the things that scholar was saying are a bit worrying.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All that talk about there being no magic in the mirror any more...\nIt doesn't look promising.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When you travel around so much like this, you end up with too many choices.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And what's that supposed to mean?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I mean it'll be hard to decide where to live once we've taken care of Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: You should all probably start thinking about what you're going to do once it's over too.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I've already got that sorted!\nI'm gonna stick with the guv 'ere for good!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You really LOVE the GUV, huh!?", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: It's a good job there's a way of gettin' magic back into the mirror, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Otherwise that prob'ly would've been the end of our journey.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We've had to take a few detours, but finally we can concentrate on Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: What a nuisance that there's only one spell that can restore the magic to the mirror!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Think how much easier it would be if one of my spells worked on it!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When you travel around so much like this, you end up with too many choices.", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: All that talk about there being no magic in the mirror any more...\nIt doesn't look promising.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah. But at least ya know where you is wiv a monster, eh?\nNot like babysittin' princes an' the like.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Who knows!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe this monster will be really ill and at death's door...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And let me guess! It'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: But the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, or something... And what are we going to do then?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All we have to do is use the mirror to absorb a spell and then its magic will be restored.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose not just any old spell will do?\nOf course it couldn't possibly be that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get this out of the way sharpish, eh.\nWe don't 'ave time to faff about.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We ain't goin' 'ome 'til we've given Dhoulmagus the wot-for in the Dark Ruins, so we'll just 'ave to do wot it takes to get at 'im.", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: That's the plan.\nI don't want to be around my brother any more for one thing.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And the Abbot was my only real friend at the abbey. Once I've avenged his death, I won't have any more ties with the place.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why d'you 'ate your brother so much, eh?\nYou've only got the one, after all.\nShouldn't you 'ave a bash at gettin' on?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's him who hates me.\nI don't have any feelings for him at all...\nNone whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry up back to the Dark Ruins.\nHopefully that mirror we spent so much effort getting hold of will take us to Dhoulmagus at last.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When we got the magic mirror in Argonia, I thought we were just a breath away from defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But this should be the end of the distractions.\nNow it's time to finish him off once and for all!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm well pleased that I could take you an' the old codger to Pickham on our travels!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I don't get why Angelo didn't take to the place.\nSuch a pity! Ha ha ha!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If Alistair lost to this guy, we should be ready for a tough fight!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: You've got a cheek talking about me like that!\nAnd what's with the weird laugh anyway!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I have to avenge the Abbot's death before I can properly draw a line under my life at the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When I first set off, I was under orders and nothing more.\nBut now I feel like this is my own duty.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: D'you think Jessica went off because she don't like us, guv?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah? You reckon that could be it, eh? Maybe I said summat to upset 'er. I mean, untension'bly, like.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: In that case, we've gotta find 'er again so's I can say sorry.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Hey, 'ere's a thought... Maybe she got caught up in somefin' weird and got kidnapped!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I dunno! Listen to me goin' on! I'm well confused!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's a bit strange not having Jessica around. I'd almost go so far as to say I miss her. A bit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one.\nShe's a brave one, that Jess.<page>Yangus: You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We should ask after Jessica in Argonia rather than just wandering around aimlessly.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's ask first and look later.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: I love how the ferry never stops running, even at a time like this.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Sailors are a pretty laid-back lot. Or maybe they just don't know what's going on? I find it quite comforting, to tell you the truth.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It ain't bad goin' on the ferry every now an' then, even when you've got yer own boat.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I was so clingy and helpless that day I turned up at the abbey as a child...", true],

		["<se_low>Morrie: Aaah, the oceano breeze... It feels so good. If the Lord of Darkness destroys the world, we will never feel this breeze again, ay?", true],
