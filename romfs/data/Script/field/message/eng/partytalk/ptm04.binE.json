		["<se_def>Angelo: All that talk about there being no magic in the mirror any more...\nIt doesn't look promising.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah. But at least ya know where you is wiv a monster, eh?\nNot like babysittin' princes an' the like.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Who knows!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe this monster will be really ill and at death's door...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And it'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: ... but the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, so we'll have to travel the world in search of the key...<page>Jessica: ... win a game of chess with a legendary pirate captain, get into some entertaining scrapes, defeat the dragon...<page>Jessica: ...and realise that the only thing we ever really needed was love...\nAND THEN WHAT!?", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get this out of the way sharpish, eh.\nWe don't 'ave time to faff about.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We ain't goin' 'ome 'til we've given Dhoulmagus the wot-for in the Dark Ruins, so we'll just 'ave to do wot it takes to get at 'im.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Angelo, are you going to leave the Templars when we've defeated Dhoulmagus?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: That's the plan.\nI don't want to be around my brother any more for one thing.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And the Abbot was my only real friend at the abbey. Once I've avenged his death, I won't have any more ties with the place.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why d'you 'ate your brother so much, eh?\nYou've only got the one, after all.\nShouldn't you 'ave a bash at gettin' on?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: It's him who hates me.\nI don't have any feelings for him at all...\nNone whatsoever.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Let's hurry up back to the Dark Ruins.\nHopefully that mirror we spent so much effort getting hold of will take us to Dhoulmagus at last.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When we got the magic mirror in Argonia, I thought we were just a breath away from defeating Dhoulmagus.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: But this should be the end of the distractions.\nNow it's time to finish him off once and for all!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I'm well pleased that I could take you an' the old codger to Pickham on our travels!", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Te he he he hee!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: You've got a cheek talking about me like that!\nAnd what's with the weird laugh anyway!?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I have to avenge the Abbot's death before I can properly draw a line under my life at the abbey.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: When I first set off, I was under orders and nothing more.\nBut now I feel like this is my own duty.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one.\nShe's a brave one, that Jess.<page>Yangus: You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
