		["<se_low>Yangus: We may 'ave defeated that dog, but I still don't really feel like we got revenge for Marta dyin' like that.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: We should polish off Rhapthorne once an' for all before we go visitin' 'er grave. Make sure we've got somefin' good to tell 'er, like.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: The great sage must have left these monuments because he knew the Lord of Darkness would return one day.<page>Jessica: He created them to warn future generations.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: If you think about it that way, we failed him, because Rhapthorne is back.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: ...But he hasn't conquered the world yet!\nIf we give it our all, there's still a chance we can stop him!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Looks like Marek's doing a good job of tending Marta's herb garden.", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Poor old Marta was one o' them sage 'eirs, eh?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: For 'er sake, we should make sure we get all them orbs an' knock Rhapthorne's block off!", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: According to Empyrea, the seven orbs contain the power of the great sages' bloodlines.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: The heirs to the seven sages may have been killed, but their spirits live on inside the orbs.<page>Jessica: That means Alistair and Marta will be fighting right alongside us.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If you don't know where to find the orbs, you'd be better off using the echo flute than asking me for advice.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Don't worry. I doubt it'll cause an avalanche. Give it a try.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: If you think about it, we seem to have become Empyrea's lackeys.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I know we would've had to find a way to defeat Rhapthorne anyway...but I do find this menial labour a bit hard to swallow. Hah!", true],
