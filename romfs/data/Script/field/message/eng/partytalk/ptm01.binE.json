		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],

		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: All we have to do is use the mirror to absorb a spell and then its magic will be restored.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose not just any old spell will do?\nOf course it couldn't possibly be that simple.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Let's get this out of the way sharpish, eh.\nWe don't 'ave time to faff about.", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: Angelo, are you going to leave the Templars when we've defeated Dhoulmagus?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: That's the plan.\nI don't want to be around my brother any more for one thing.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: And the Abbot was my only real friend at the abbey. Once I've avenged his death, I won't have any more ties with the place.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Why d'you 'ate your brother so much, eh?\nYou've only got the one, after all.\nShouldn't you 'ave a bash at gettin' on?", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: We should make sure we're properly prepared before we go back to the Dark Ruins.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Jessica's a bit strange when you think about it. She's supposed to be a lady and yet here she is, hunting down her brother's killer!", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: She may be a lady by name, but she's from the sticks, ain't she? Just the same as the local yokels at the end o' the day!", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: You've got a cheek talking about me like that!\nAnd what's with the weird laugh anyway!?", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Hey, 'ere's a thought... Maybe she got caught up in somefin' weird and got kidnapped!?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Oh, I dunno! Listen to me goin' on! I'm well confused!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: I suppose it's a bit strange not having Jessica around. I'd almost go so far as to say I miss her. A bit.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah, you're not the only one.\nShe's a brave one, that Jess.<page>Yangus: You can see it in 'ow she puffs 'er chest out, all proud, when she fights.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Oh, is that what that is? The first time I met her, I thought she must be hiding some water balloons in there.<page>Angelo: I feared for the dryness of my uniform, I can tell you!", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: We should ask after Jessica in Argonia rather than just wandering around aimlessly.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Let's ask first and look later.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Didn't you say that the people of Farebury went into a tizzy when they caught sight of King Trode?", true],

		["<se_high>Jessica: I know she's only telling it like it is, but it still gets me down...", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: D'ya think Kalderasha an' Valentina are gonna be awright?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: I doubt monsters are gonna come into town, but I can't 'elp worryin' about it.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: So this is where the magician, Master Rylus, lived... And he was one of the heirs of the great sages, too.", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: How ironic that Dhoulmagus ended up with ultimate power once he took the sceptre. Talk about the pupil outgrowing his master!", true],
