		["<se_def>Angelo: How bizarre that the only thing that can return magic to the mirror is some kind of sea monster.", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: Yeah. But at least ya know where you is wiv a monster, eh?\nNot like babysittin' princes an' the like.", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Who knows!?", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: Maybe this monster will be really ill and at death's door...", true],
		["<se_high>Jessica: And let me guess! It'll tell us we have to fetch the medicine to cure it before it casts the spell for us...<page>Jessica: But the medicine's ingredients are locked away in a dungeon guarded by a dragon, or something... And what are we going to do then?", true],
		["<se_def>Angelo: Has anyone ever told you that you worry too much?", true],

		["<se_low>Yangus: Er, guv... I don't wanna be pushy, like, but can I just ask ya somefin'?", true],
		["<se_low>Yangus: It's just that we've been a bit of a while now... Don't ya think we should be makin' a move back to Arcadia before too long?", true],
