		["<se_low>You cut a dashing figure, I must say, <hero>. Not quite as handsome as yours truly in his heyday, but close. They called me the \u2018dapperling of Trodain\u2019, don't you know!", true],

		["<se_low>Were it not for this debilitating curse, I would be leading you into battle myself and fighting by your side! Ah, what a terrible shame!", true],
		["<se_low>I'm not worried about me. It's my darling Medea.\nIf I fail to return her to normal, my dear late wife will see to it that my afterlife is most unpleasant!", true],
		["<se_low>It's all about spirit! Spirit is absolutely fundamental! Let your spirit be defeated, and a victory in battle is no victory at all!", true],
		["<se_low>To be honest, a little more strength wouldn't go amiss. Otherwise you won't be able to make use of some of my more advanced tactics.", true],
		["<se_low>What we really need is a master of magic! I used to be a formidable magician myself, you know. Yes, if only I were a couple of years younger! Pity!", true],

		["<se_low>There's no shame in a bit of intimidation, you know! Eliminating a few of your enemies by scaring them off is a perfectly valid strategy!", true],
		["<se_low>Do you know, that old ailment I had for such a long time has finally cleared up since I've undergone my \u2018change\u2019. Every cloud has a silver lining, I suppose.", true],

		["<se_low>I suppose at this stage it rather goes without saying, but the world really is vast! Walking around like this certainly brings it home to one.", true],
		["<se_low>The Trodain Tome of Tactics is my bible! I don't need to consult it in paper form any more. Every item of wisdom it contains is engraved in my mind!", true],
		["<se_low>Now is the time to refine your skills in\npreparation for grappling with Dhoulmagus!\nThe great battle is nigh!", true],
		["<se_low>I may have been turned into a monster, but at\nleast I still have the freedom to move about.\nI'm thankful for that. The others in my castle suffered a far worse fate.", true],
		["<se_low>Well done! You've become markedly stronger. But I don't want to see your training slip after you've defeated Dhoulmagus! You can never be too good!", true],
		["<se_low>Once we've dispatched Dhoulmagus, I shall call for a banquet of unprecedented proportions at the castle! We'll have ourselves a bally bellyful!", true],
		["<se_low>All of you can buy new outfits whenever you want to, while I'm just a one-frock girl. As it were.\nI hanker for a fine tweed or some crisp linens myself, you know.", true],
		["<se_low>I considered establishing a casino in Trodain Castle at one time, you know. But there were some<...>concerns about public safety, so I had to abandon the idea.", true],
		["<se_low>It's all too common to see people decide on a battle strategy and then refuse to waver from it.\nBut variety is the key! You must realise when to switch to a new strategy!", true],
		["<se_low>We have come a considerable distance together\nnow, haven't we? Perhaps it would be wise to\nrevisit some of the places we have already been\nto, once in a while.", true],
		["<se_low>If you continue to grow in strength like this,\nI shouldn't be surprised to see you make it as a professional pugilist in the not-too-distant future!", true],
		["<se_low>I feel rather as if we have traversed the entire world! Is there anywhere we have not yet been!?", true],
		["<se_low>The sea harbours less monsters than the land,\nbut occasionally disgorges some fearful beasts.\nThere is no room for unpreparedness.", true],
		["<se_low>Wisdom has more than a slight bearing on the effectiveness of one's magic, you know.\nHm? Oh, I see you didn't know!\nWell, learn from the master!", true],
		["<se_low>Being raised in a royal household, I was exposed to little of the outside world. I had no idea it was so many times larger than Trodain!", true],
		["<se_low>Now we have become the seasoned travellers we are, I submit that we need a theme song! Something catchy. Perhaps we could write it ourselves?", true],
		["<se_low>.........I would rather not talk today. My ulcers are causing me some discomfort.", true],
		["<se_low>I thought everything would return to normal if we could just defeat Dhoulmagus. Aaah... Things are never as simple as they first appear.", true],
		["<se_low>That twerp Yangus will not desist from calling me \u2018Grandad\u2019! He knows full well I despise the name! And anyway, I still have my youthful looks,\ndo I not!?", true],
		["<se_low>Recently, I've been speculating that perhaps there\nis just no way to return me to my old...er, former<...>handsome appearance.", true],
		["<se_low>I'm starting to feel rather disheartened by the continued failure to solve my predicament, but\nyou seem to be going from strength to strength.", true],
		["<se_low>With my royal upbringing, I wanted for very little as a child. But to fly! I truly believed that was beyond even a king's reach.", true],
		["<se_low>I cannot return to my castle as it is now.\nNo, we shall just have to see this through now.", true],
		["<se_low>I have to confess I have no more advice to impart. From now on, you shall have to devise your own strategies for battle.", true],
		["<se_low>Yes. Don't be so embroiled in everything I have taught you up to now that it hinders your own fighting style. Forget this battle chronicle!\nFree your mind!", true],
		["<se_low>When I finally manage to bid farewell to my outmoded \u2018monster look\u2019, I shall summon all the tailors in the world and hold the King Trode Fashion Extravaganza!", true],

		["<se_low>Having been cursed like this, I am in a very\nstrong position to educate you about monsters!\nThey're not all bad, you know. Some are rather well-to-do, I tell you!", true],
		["<se_low>Soon after we set off from Trodain and arrived\nin Farebury, I was confident that everything\nwould be resolved before long. But that was some time ago now!", true],
		["<se_low>With the benefit of hindsight, of course, we know Dhoulmagus was merely a pawn in a far grander scheme. It's really rather extraordinary.", true],
		["<se_low>Well I've been a monster and I've been a bird!\nBut just for one day, I'd rather like to experience what it's like to be a pretty young girl!", true],
		["<se_low>You've yet to experience a real battle, of course,\nbut you have at least started along the right lines.", true],
		["<se_low>You have yet to experience a proper battle.\nAnd I'm a little nervous, I must confess.", true],
		["<se_low>Hm. You've certainly managed to be wiped out a fair few times. You might have more success holding back and adopting a more cautious attitude.", true],
		["<se_low>Well! Intimidating your adversaries is one thing,\nbut if you keep doing it all the time, I'll start to wonder if you're all bark and no trousers!", true],
		["<se_low>This is what happens when you push yourself to the limit in every battle. You end up having to flee from them all! You mustn't overstretch yourself.", true],
		["<se_low>It seems you're fleeing from battle fairly often.\nNot to worry, it's a strategy just like any other!", true],
		["<se_low>Are you a man or a snail!? You have been dawdling about, haven't you!? Come along, now! Stop wasting time and get that crystal ball!", true],
		["<se_low>By George! You've got rather strong, I see!\nGet any more mountainously muscular, and\nyou'll have people abseiling off you!", true],
		["<se_low>Sometimes it's just impossible to avoid being wiped out. Still, you should think carefully about how best to heal yourself so that you don't end up dead!", true],

		["<se_low>It is a fine thing to immerse yourself in combat, I'm sure. Most admirable! But don't forget the task at hand! The crystal ball, hm!?", true],
		["<se_low>You appear to be making a bit of a meal out of all this. If your opponents seem too brawny for you, perhaps you should try exchanging your weapons?", true],
		["<se_low>Oh dear! You aren't in possession of a single medicinal herb! I really think you ought to purchase at least one!", true],
		["<se_low>Well, you certainly seem fond of your medicinal herbs! Most wise! Don't let anyone tell you otherwise!", true],
		["<se_low>Yes, not at all bad. You seem to be fighting rather well. Using the \u2018bat down any monsters who get in your way\u2019 strategy, hm!?", true],
		["<se_low>I couldn't say you're the greatest fighters I've ever seen, but I suppose you'll do. Keep going as you are, and no doubt you will improve.", true],
		["<se_low>You're not having much luck intimidating monsters, are you? That's because you're still\nrather weak. Moderate your use of that strategy until you're a little tougher.", true],
		["<se_low>Not an outstanding performance, but good enough to pass, I suppose. Keep up the good work.", true],
		["<se_low>You seem to be more seasoned travellers than I realised. You're proving to be most reliable.\nJust what I expect from my retainers!\nVery good.", true],
		["<se_low>You are really rather accomplished in battle.\nIt just goes to show that it's not all about strength.\nYes! Strategy, you see! Just as I said!", true],
		["<se_low>We're in a serious spot of bother here! Try to avoid getting into any battles, and just pray we can get safely back to a town.", true],
		["<se_low>It's a fair distance back to town from the cave. I'm a little concerned that we may run into trouble.", true],
		["<se_low>Well, now we've got the crystal ball, we should try to avoid battles as best we can on the return journey. It's most important to have a plan,\nyou know!", true],
		["<se_low>Our mission was to acquire the crystal ball.\nNow we have it, we should remain inconspicuous\non the way back to town. So avoid battles.\nYes, a splendid strategy!", true],

		["<se_low>Hm... It seems you're struggling. If your opponents seem too brawny for you, perhaps you should try exchanging your weapons?", true],
		["<se_low>Perhaps you should start getting used to building up a little tension. I do like to see what my retainers can produce when they really clench up.", true],
		["<se_low>Not an outstanding performance, but good enough to pass, I suppose. Keep up the good work.", true],
		["<se_low>The most important thing now is to resurrect <hero>. The problem is deciding whether we should carry on or go back.", true],
		["<se_low>The most important thing now is to resurrect that nincompoop Yangus. The problem is deciding whether we should carry on or go back.", true],
		["<se_low>Hmph! You have no misgivings when it comes to intimidating your opponents, then? Especially the weaker ones! Your cowardice is palpable!", true],
		["<se_low>I know you face some life-threatening battles, and I'm not accusing you of using underhand tactics, but shame on you for turning tail so often!", true],
		["<se_low>If this is to be the pace for our entire journey,\nI fear I may be in my grave before we see its end. Onwards, I say!", true],

		["<se_low>It looks like it may take some time to catch up\nwith Dhoulmagus at this rate. But never fear, determination will see us through!", true],
		["It's one thing being wiped out in a heated battle, but quite another for the lot of you to die through careless distraction! More vigilance, I say!", true],
		["<se_low>I was quite a comely catch in my younger years. I spent a good deal of time fleeing from over-excited young maidens, so I fully understand your tactics.", true],
		["<se_low>You're not doing at all badly. If anything, I suppose you exhibit a slightly worrying reliance on intimidation tactics.", true],
		["<se_low>If you want to scare your opponents off, you need\na keen eye for your respective strengths. You won't intimidate monsters who are stronger than you.", true],
		["<se_low>I see you haven't been shying away from battle! Well, your experience will no doubt tell you that a little haste can be necessary once in a while. Hm?", true],
		["<se_low>Well I wouldn't be able to single you out in a crowd, but I suppose your skills are good enough for a pass. Keep up the good work.", true],
		["<se_low>Minimal effort, maximal results! Splendid!\nI must congratulate myself on having such exceptional retainers!", true],
		["<se_low>Good, good! A most encouraging pace indeed!\nCarry on at this tempo, and we shall soon hem\nin the accursed Dhoulmagus!", true],
